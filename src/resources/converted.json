Committees may exist that advise or influence this person but team\n    members who want to change an item's priority must first convince the Product Owner. In this way, organizational\n    methods for setting priorities and requirements are influenced over time by this role.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For the Product Owner to succeed, everyone in the organization must respect their decisions. No one is allowed to\n    direct the development team member to work from a different set of priorities. Team members are not allowed to follow the direction\n    of anyone whose direction does not coincide with the direction provided by the Product Owner. The Product Owner’s\n    decisions are visible in the content and prioritization of the Product Backlog. This visibility requires that the\n    Product Owner do their best. Visibility makes the role of Product Owner both a demanding and a rewarding experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The Product Owner is responsible for the first of the three Scrum ceremonies, Sprint/Iteration Planning. The development team evaluates\n    the prioritized Product Backlog, identifies the top priority items, and commits to completing the selected items during\n    a Sprint/Iteration. These items become the basis for the Sprint/Iteration Backlog.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In return for the development team's commitment to completing the selected tasks, the Product Owner commits that they will\n    not introduce new requirements to the team during the Sprint/Iteration. Requirements are allowed to change but only outside the\n    Sprint/Iteration. After the team begins a Sprint/Iteration, it remains focused on the goals of that Sprint/Iteration. The only exception to this\n    rule is that a similar amount of work can be removed from a Sprint/Iteration to accommodate a new requirement.\n</p>"

                      "<p>\n    There are several use scenarios for <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/method_configuration_C2B8FA8A.html\"\n    guid=\"__V7pAMaEEduMlb2cQZNTYw\">method configuration</a>s produced by using EPF Composer or Rational Method Composer\n    (both referred to generically here as \"Method Composer\"). The simplest&nbsp;is to use the&nbsp;published content as-is\n    (either using a prepublished Web site or by publishing one using the content that is included with Method\n    Composer).&nbsp;However, you may be&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;how to add, remove, suppress, or modify <a\n    class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/method_content_6972AE81.html\"\n    guid=\"_Ts2joB_MEdq6CKKKq4D7YA\">method content</a>&nbsp;or <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/process_68E308B4.html\"\n    guid=\"_yQ5m2NnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA\">process</a>&nbsp;elements, or both, to make an existing method configuration\n    more&nbsp;suitable&nbsp;to your teams' needs, while keeping it consistent and understandable.\n</p>This guidance page describes typical customization scenarios and&nbsp;then provides references to additional\ninformation on how to customize methods.\n<h3>\n    Customization scenarios\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The following sections describe&nbsp;possible customization scenarios. For information on specific tool features,\n    consult the Method Composer online Help. For&nbsp;additional information on customizing methods, see the Additional\n    Resources section that follows here.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Use existing plug-ins and packages to build your own process\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Some consider this the most straight-forward customization scenario. Based on the provided content, you can use Method\n    Composer to pick and choose the packages with the content that you want to publish and make available to your team.\n    Removing a method package removes all references to the content of that package from the published process. For\n    example, you can simplify a process to have it contain a minimal subset of its content by removing packages that\n    contain elements of work that you do not want to perform. You do this by creating a new method configuration (or\n    copying an existing one) into your method library. You can select packages as appropriate without affecting the\n    configuration provided.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Add&nbsp;method content&nbsp;that your team needs\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Some teams may need to perform a different task that is not covered by the standard content. Maybe they need to perform\n    an extra step in an existing task, or they may need to add a new guideline for a given technique that they are\n    following. Eventually, they need a new template for a document (or they may need to add or remove sections in an\n    existing template).\n</p>\n<p>\n    In such situations, the recommended approach is to create a separate plug-in in your library.&nbsp;It is not a good\n    practice&nbsp;to make changes in the provided plug-in (meaning any plug-in for which you do not have control), because\n    new versions of these plug-ins, when deployed, can override the changes that you have made.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Method Composer provides a series of mechanisms that allow you to indirectly modify the content in an existing plug-in\n    by using <i>content variability</i>. In your plug-in, you can define an element that contributes, extends, or replaces\n    an element in the existing plug-in. For example, in your plug-in, you can define a task that contributes a new step to\n    an existing task. You can also define a new artifact that replaces an existing artifact, and this new artifact can have\n    a different name, structure, and associated template, for example. Then all you need to do is make sure that the\n    existing plug-in and your new plug-in are part of the configuration to be published. During publication, Method\n    Composer will resolve the content variability that you defined by adding the new content into the existing content\n    where appropriate, replacing existing content with the content you defined, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Define a different development lifecycle\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Both method content and process are created independently from&nbsp;each other. For example, you create tasks in the\n    method content (and define their&nbsp;inputs, outputs, and responsible roles), but you do not necessarily define the\n    lifecycle of your process, meaning the sequence in which the various tasks will be performed. On the process side, you\n    then define the lifecycle (such as phases, iterations, activities, and tasks), as well as the precedence among these\n    elements.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Some teams may find the method content appropriate without any further customization, but they may want to work by\n    following a different software development lifecycle. For example, some teams may like the four development phases and\n    iterations from the unified process, but some may want to develop iteratively, without being tied to a specific phase\n    structure. Again, you can add, remove and replace elements in the work breakdown structure of an existing process by\n    applying process variability.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As an alternative to tailoring an existing process, you can write a completely new process that reuses activities from\n    one or more existing processes. In cases where you cannot find any reusable material at all, you can also create a\n    completely new process from scratch. In most cases, however, you will start developing your own process by assembling\n    reusable building blocks from method content, as well as predefined process patterns&nbsp;called <a\n    class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html\"\n    guid=\"_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA\">capability patterns</a>. The resulting assembled process is called a&nbsp;<a\n    class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/delivery_process_BCDF50B7.html\"\n    guid=\"_ZufeMCO3EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA\">delivery process</a>. This newly created delivery process&nbsp;is part of a\n    configuration that you publish and make available to members of your team.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Publish the process Web site\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Every customization scenario is finalized by publishing content as HTML (on a Web site). Method Composer enables you to\n    publish&nbsp;content based on a given configuration, which will publish all of the content available from\n    the&nbsp;method and process packages selected in that configuration. Another option for publishing is to select only\n    the capability patterns or delivery process of interest. This will make available only the content related to the\n    process packages that you select.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For the published Web site look and feel, you can customize the views and nodes in the directory (tree) browser by\n    defining <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/custom_category_554AC4D6.html\"\n    guid=\"_eqw94MaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw\">custom categories</a> that will be part of your configuration.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Additional resources&nbsp;\n</h3>\n<p>\n    For more information on the fundamental concepts of method content and process, see <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/concepts/basic_process_concepts_C90EF089.html\"\n    guid=\"_FxJEkFUKEd2_rMtRMt_EMg\">Concept: Basic Process Concepts</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For information on EPF Composer, see <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.tool_def.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/epf_resources_446F3946.html\"\n    guid=\"_C2FS4F_lEd2zpKtX6B7lBg\">EPF Resources</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For information on Rational Method Composer, see <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.tool_def.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/rational_method_composer_resources_ADE2B192.html\"\n     guid=\"_dlGBQF_nEd2zpKtX6B7lBg\">Rational Method Composer Resources</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For detailed customization scenarios, consult the tutorials included in the Method Composer online Help, as well the\n    general authoring topics.\n</p>"

Tool and technology specific guidance\n    can be added, such as guidance on J2EE, and a variety of development tools. Some of these extensions can be quite\n    modest, adding&nbsp;for example&nbsp;just tool specific guidance to existing tasks, while others can be comprehensive,\n    defining processes that provide a radically expanded scope with new or altered artifacts, new or altered tasks, and new\n    or altered roles.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Extensions and additions to the practices can be the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        being used internally by an organization;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        open source as a part of the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) project;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        made freely available outside the open source licenses of Eclipse (EPL);\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        sold commercially as an extension to the basic framework, such as the IBM(R) Practices.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Incremental Adoption\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Each practice is described as a standalone capability that can be adopted by an organization or project.&nbsp;Each\n    practice may include enablement materials that explain how to get started.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Easy to Configure and Use\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Creating a method is as simple as selecting the practices that you wish to adopt, and then publishing the\n    results.&nbsp;Each practice adds itself into the framework so that content can be viewed by practice, or across\n    practices by work product, role, task and so on.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Community Development\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Since a practice can be easily authored on its own, practices are ideal for community development.&nbsp;The basic agile\n    practices for the&nbsp;EPF Practices are, in fact, developed by the Eclipse Process Framework community.&nbsp;\n</p>"

There are a variety of ways to participate in the development and\n    deployment of EPF, depending on your interest and skill level.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        If all that you want to do is ask a few questions to get started, sign up for the <b>EPF Newsgroup</b> (more\n        information follows).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        If you want to participate in discussions and decisions about the content and direction of EPF, sign up for the\n        <b>epf-dev mailing list</b>.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Use Bugzilla to get your hands dirty by reporting bugs and enhancements, verifying the correctness of method\n        content, or submitting method content to address process issues.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Participate at the highest levels by joining technical and committee meetings. These meetings are where detailed\n        process issues and product strategy are discussed.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Everyone who downloads or uses EPF content is encouraged to participate at some level. EPF is only as good as the\n    quality of the participation of its contributors.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    EPF newsgroup\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The EPF Newsgroup is the place to ask and answer questions about OpenUP, EPF Composer, and other EPF processes. Most of\n    the traffic involves how to use EPF Composer, EPF Practices, and OpenUP. It's monitored by the community, and you can\n    access it as you do any newsgroup. Everyone who uses EPF will benefit from the support it offers and by receiving\n    announcements. Sign up for the <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/epf/community/community_index.php\"\n    target=\"_blank\">newsgroup now.</a>\n</p>\n<h4>\n    EPF-dev mailing list\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The epf-dev mailing list is used by the EPF development community to communicate and discuss development issues. Sign\n    up for the <a href=\"https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/epf-dev\" target=\"_blank\">mailing list</a> to participate\n    in technical discussions and receive meeting announcements.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Bugs, enhancements, and process content\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Bugzilla is the tool used to track changes and tasks for EPF. Bugzilla is the Work Items List for the EPF project and\n    contains the requirements, enhancements, bugs, to-do items, and so forth for the project. Anyone in the community is\n    invited to report bugs and enhancements, to provide content addressing the bugs and enhancements, and to help validate\n    that the content is correct. You can provide content simply by adding an attachment to any Bugzilla entry.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Learn how to use <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/epf/process/change_request_faq.php\" target=\"_blank\">Bugzilla change\n    requests</a> for EPF.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Content can be submitted as text files or exported from EPF Composer as plug-ins or XML. Edit the latest version of the\n    libraries by downloading them from the CVS in EPF Composer. Set up EPF Composer to download the practices library by\n    following the instructions on the <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/epf/composer_dev_guide/cvs_setup.php\"\n    target=\"_blank\">EPF Composer Development Guide</a>. Note that only committers can commit changes to the CVS. Any\n    changes made by contributors must be attached to a Bugzilla entry.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Meetings and committees\n</h4>\n<p>\n    There are numerous meetings every week to discuss progress and define solutions.

Practices are intended as\n    \"chunks\" of process for adoption, enablement, and configuration. Practices are built from the basic elements described\n    above.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Configuration\n</h4>\n<p>\n    From the end-user perspective, a configuration is a selection of method content to be published.&nbsp; Most\n    configurations consist of a selection of practices plus some&nbsp;content to tie the practices together. The published\n    configuration is often loosely referred to as a process website.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Details and Examples\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The following provides more detail about the basic elements and provides some examples.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Work product\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Work products may take various shapes or forms, such as:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Documents, such as a Vision, or a Project Plan.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        A model, such as a Use-Case Model or a Design Model. These can contain model elements (sub-artifacts) such as\n        Design Classes, Use Cases, and Design Subsystems.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Databases, spreadsheets, and other information repositories.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Source code and executables.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Work products can be classified as \"artifacts\" if they are concrete things, \"outcomes\" if they are not concrete, and\n    \"deliverables\" if they are a packaging of artifacts.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Role\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A role defines the behavior and responsibilities of an individual, or a set of individuals working together as a team,\n    within the context of a software engineering organization.<br />\n    Note that roles are not individuals; instead, roles describe responsibilities. An individual will typically take on\n    several roles at one time, and frequently will change roles over the duration of the project.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Some examples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Analyst&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;Represents customers and end users, gathers input from stakeholders and\n        defines requirements.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Developer -</strong> Develops a part of the system, including designing, implementing, unit testing, and\n        integrating.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Task\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A task is work performed by a role. It is usually defined as a series of steps that involve creating or updating one or\n    more work products.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Some examples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Develop a vision -</strong> Develop an overall vision for the system, including capturing the problem to be\n        solved, the key stakeholders, the scope and boundary of the system, the system's key features, and any constraints.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Plan Iteration -</strong> Define the scope and responsibilities of a single iteration.\n    </li>\n</ul><br />\n<h4>\n    Process\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Processes pull together tasks, work products, and roles, and add structure and sequencing information.&nbsp; Tasks or\n    work products can be grouped into higher level activities, called a work breakdown structure\n    (WBS).&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities or tasks can be marked as \"planned\" to identify work that you expect to assign and track.\n</p><br />\n<br />\n<center>\n    <img\n    alt=\"This is an example work breakdown structure, showing a hierarchy of activities with sub-activities and tasks.\"\n    src=\"core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/concepts/resources/wbs_example.jpg\" align=\"center\" />&nbsp;<br />\n    Figure 1: Example Work Breakdown\n</center><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n    Diagrams can be added to providing sequencing information.&nbsp; The following example shows an initial activity, \"Plan\n    Test Cycle\", followed by two activities that go in parallel, \"Monitor and Control Test\" and \"Test\".\n</p><br />\n<br />\n<center>\n    <img height=\"453\"\n    alt=\"Example UML activity diagram, showing a start, an initial activity, then two activities in parallel, and an end.\"\n    src=\"core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/concepts/resources/activity_diag_ex.jpg\" width=\"566\" align=\"center\" /><br />\n    Figure&nbsp;2: Example Activity Diagram\n</center><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n    Note that a&nbsp;reusable partial process is sometimes referred to as a capability pattern.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    For More Information\n</h3>\n<p>\n    More in-depth material on these concepts is generally found in articles on EPF Composer and Rational(R) Method\n    Composer, which use these concepts as building blocks.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        To learn more about the Eclipse Process Framework Project and EPF Composer,&nbsp;&nbsp;visit <a\n        href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/epf\">http://www.eclipse.org/epf</a>&nbsp;and <a\n        href=\"http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/05/1011_kroll/index.html\">http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/05/1011_kroll/index.html</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        For more information on Rational Method Composer, see:\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                The RMC Product Page on developer works <a\n                href=\"http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rmc/\">http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rmc/</a>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Article: \"IBM Rational Method Composer: Part 1: Key concepts\" at <a\n                href=\"http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/dec05/haumer/index.html\">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/dec05/haumer/index.html</a>\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        For an in-depth explanation of the meta-model on which EPF Composer and Rational Method Composer are based, see:\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none\">\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                OMG, \"Software Process Engineering Meta model,\" version 1.1, formal/2005-01-06, 2005. <a\n                href=\"http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/spem.htm\">http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/spem.htm</a><br />\n                <br />\n                <br />\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>"

To clarify, let's start by defining what is meant by measure and by metric.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Measure</b>: A raw data item that is directly measured, and that will be used to calculate a metric.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Metric</b>: An interpretation of a measure or a set of measures that you use to guide your project. For example,\n        recording how many test cases have passed and how many have failed are measures. Interpreting what level of quality\n        this indicates and how it reflects the team's progress within the current iteration is a metric.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    <font size=\"5\">Why Measure?</font>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Measurements will mainly help you to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Communicate effectively</b>. Measurement supports effective communication among team members and project\n        stakeholders.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Identify and correct problems early</b>. Measurement enables you to identify and manage potential problems early\n        in the development lifecycle.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Make informed trade-offs</b>. Measurement helps objectively assess the impact of decisions, helping&nbsp;the\n        team&nbsp;make trade-off decisions to best meet project goals.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Tune estimations</b>. Recording schedule, progress, and expenditures for projects will help team members to make\n        more reliable estimations in the future.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    <font size=\"5\">Potential Challenges</font>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    There are several dangers when it comes to metrics:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <div align=\"left\">\n            <b>They can be too costly</b>. The benefit provided by the metric must exceed the cost of collecting it. Keep\n            your measurements simple and easy to collect.\n        </div>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <div align=\"left\">\n            <b>They're a poor substitute for communication</b>. Do not use metrics as a substitute for communication. Team\n            members may help to decide which metrics make sense for the project. Apply metrics not so much to control the\n            project but to help team to collaborate better. Asking people about their progress is a co-dependent way of\n            gaining insight into progress.\n        </div>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <div align=\"left\">\n            <b>They can be misleading</b>. No metric or collection of metrics is perfect. Furthermore, the measurements\n            upon which they are based can be manipulated by the people capturing them. Don't rely simply upon metrics to\n            manage a project.\n        </div>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Effective metrics programs can be challenging to implement, though typically not because of the statistics and complex\n    analysis often associated with metrics. Rather, the challenge lies in understanding which metrics add value to the\n    project and to the company, and which procedures are most efficient for collecting and using these metrics.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Consider implementing only a handful metrics. Importantly, do not collect metrics unless they help contribute to a goal\n    of improving a defined area of your software development process. If you will not act on a metric, do not collect it.\n    It is much more important to focus on a small number of metrics that are important to what you are trying to achieve\n    right now, versus a larger set of metrics that may be \"good to track\".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <font size=\"5\">Common Metrics</font>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Below are some common measures and associated metrics used in software development projects. These metrics help teams\n    communicate, identify and correct problems early, make informed trade-offs, and tune estimations. Example of metrics\n    coverage areas are listed below.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Software quality\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                Defect backlog: Number of defects discovered respectively resolved per iteration\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Test case coverage: Number of test cases executed over total number of test cases\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Code coverage: % of code that have been tested\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Development productivity\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                Velocity: Number of delivered points by iteration (see <a class=\"elementLink\"\n                href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation_A4EF42B3.html\"\n                guid=\"_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w\">Agile Estimation</a>)\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Development process effectiveness\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                Responsiveness to quality issues: Number of defects discovered versus resolved per iteration\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Responsiveness to process improvement proposal: Number of process enhancements proposed versus implemented\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Cost and schedule estimate and variance\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                Effort: Actual effort spent per iteration\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Cost: Cost per iteration\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Effort remaining: Track&nbsp;project burndown&nbsp;\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    There are many other measures and metrics that may make sense, based on what you are trying to accomplish. For example,\n    if you want to measure the quality of your architecture, you may choose to collect metrics related to coupling between\n    different software packages (groups of related classes) by measuring extensibility, dependency, and responsibility of\n    each package.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    What is an Iteration\n</h3>\n<p>\n    An iteration is a set period of time within a project in which you produce a stable, executable version of the product,\n    together with any other supporting documentation, install scripts, or similar, necessary to use this release. The\n    executable is demonstrable, allowing the team to demonstrate true progress to stakeholders, get feedback on how they\n    are doing so that they can improve their understanding of what needs to be done, and how to do it. Each iteration\n    builds upon the results of previous iteration, and will produce a product increment one step closer to the final\n    product. Iterations are timeboxed, meaning the schedule for an iteration should be regarded as fixed, and the scope of\n    the iteration's content actively managed to meet that schedule.\n</p>\n<p>\n    At each iteration, artifacts are updated. It is said that this is a bit like \"growing\" software. Instead of developing\n    artifacts one after another, in a pipeline fashion, they are evolving across the cycle, although at different rates.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Iterative development is very disciplined: the iteration length is fixed; the objectives of iterations are carefully\n    planned; the evaluation criteria are established when each iteration is planned; and the tasks and responsibilities of\n    participants are well defined. Additionally, objective measures of progress are captured. Some reworking takes place\n    from one iteration to the next, but this too is done in a structured fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Each iteration should address the most critical risks, and implement the highest-priority work items. This ensures that\n    each iteration adds maximum stakeholder value, while reducing uncertainty. Iterative development is typically combined\n    with frequent or continuous integration: as unit-tested components become available, they are integrated, then a build\n    is produced and subjected to integration testing. In this way, the capability of the integrated software grows as the\n    iteration proceeds, towards the goals set when the iteration was planned. Regular builds, such as daily or more\n    frequent builds, let you break down the integration and test issues and spread them across the development cycle. These\n    issues have often been the downfall of large projects because all problems were discovered at once during the single\n    massive integration step, which occurred very late in the cycle, and where a single problem halts the whole team.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Why Iterate\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The iterative approach has proven itself superior to the waterfall approach for a number of reasons:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        You are more likely to build an application that addresses user needs. Early specification of requirements often\n        leads to unused features. The Standish Group has researched thousands of application development projects and has\n        found that more than 45 percent of features are never used, while another 19 percent are used rarely&nbsp; (see\n        Figure 2.3). In other words, typically more than half of the development effort is wasted on developing\n        nonessential capabilities. To avoid this problem, you need to involve the customer in the development project and\n        use an iterative approach that allows you to implement and validate the capabilities deemed most essential in each\n        iteration. This approach allows not only early validation of key capabilities but also addition of new capabilities\n        late in the project.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Integration is not one \"big bang\" at the end of a project. Leaving integration to the end results in time- and\n        budget-consuming rework. To avoid this, an iterative approach breaks a project down into smaller iterations, each\n        evolving executable code that is continuously integrated to enable rapid feedback and minimize later revision.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Risks are usually discovered or addressed during early iterations. With the iterative approach, risks are more\n        likely to be identified and addressed in early iterations. As an example, if there is a risk that a stakeholder\n        will not be happy with the functionality you are developing, iterative development will encourage you to&nbsp;\n        implement the most essential capabilities partially and demonstrate them to key stakeholders to make sure that you\n        are on the right track.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Your ability to work effectively is fine-tuned. During early iterations, team members are walking through all\n        lifecycle activities, from requirements capture and test definition to development, implementation, and testing.\n        Consequently, they can make sure they have the tools, skills, organizational structure, and so on to work\n        effectively.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Management has a way of making tactical changes to the product. Management can make changes to the product along\n        the way-to compete with other new products, for example. Iterative development allows you to evolve partial\n        implementations of the end product quickly and use these for quick release of a reduced-scope product to counter a\n        competitor's move.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Reuse is facilitated. It is easier to identify common parts as they are being partially designed or implemented in\n        iterations than to recognize them at the beginning. Discussions and reviews of the design in early iterations allow\n        team members to spot potential opportunities for reuse and then develop a mature common code for these\n        opportunities in subsequent iterations.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Defects can be found and corrected over several iterations. This capability results in a robust architecture and a\n        high-quality application. Flaws are detected in early iterations, rather than during a massive testing phase at the\n        end. Performance bottlenecks are discovered while they can still be addressed instead of creating panic on the eve\n        of delivery.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Project personnel are better used. Many organizations match their use of a waterfall approach with a pipeline\n        organization: the analysts send the completed requirements to designers, who send a completed design to\n        programmers, who send components to integrators, who send a system to testers. These many handoffs are sources of\n        errors and misunderstandings and make people feel less responsible for the final product. An iterative process\n        encourages widening the scope of expertise of the team members, allowing them to play many roles and thus enabling\n        a project manager to make better use of the available staff and simultaneously remove problematic handoffs.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Team members learn along the way. The project members have several opportunities within a development cycle to\n        learn from their mistakes and improve their skills from one iteration to another. More training opportunities can\n        be discovered as a result of assessing the earlier iterations.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The development process itself is improved and refined along the way. The iteration assessment allows the team to\n        not only look at the project status from a product or scheduling perspective but also analyze what can be improved\n        in the next iteration in both the organization and the process.&nbsp;One technique for doing so is to hold a\n        retrospective.\n    </li>\n</ul><span class=\"E1\"><span\nstyle=\"FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: JA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\"><strong><img\n height=\"307\" alt=\"45 percent of features implemented are never ever used\" src=\"core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/resources/iteration.gif\"\nwidth=\"489\" /></strong></span></span>&nbsp;\n<p>\n    <strong><em>Figure 2.3.

Project risks may be seen as threats or opportunities. The latter means that\n    taking a calculated risk may bring, for example, competitive advantage for a product or organization. If there are\n    benefits associated with an opportunity, then you can take certain degrees of risk for a project to be successful [<a\n    class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#SEI99\"\n    guid=\"_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig\">SEI99</a>].\n</p>\n<p>\n    In everyday life a risk is an exposure to loss or injury: A factor, thing, element, or course involving uncertain\n    danger.

One way of doing this is to divide risks into categories\n        (such as technical, project management, organizational, and external), to ensure that all aspects of the project\n        which are prone to risk are covered.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Risk Type:</b> Used to classify the risk as:\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none\">\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                Direct or Indirect risk: if the project has or does not have a large degree of control over the risk\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Resource&nbsp;risk: organization, people, funding, or time\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Business risk\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Technical risk: scope, technology, or external dependency\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Schedule risk\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Risk Probability:</b> How likely the risk event will happen.

It simply gives another\n        party responsibility for its management. It doesn't eliminate the risk.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Common response strategies for positive risks or opportunities include:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n    <li>\n        <b>Exploit</b>: Add work or reorganize the project to make sure that the opportunity occurs (it is the reverse of\n        avoid)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Enhance</b>: Define actions to increase the probability or the positive impact of the risk (this is the reverse\n        of mitigate)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Share</b>: Allocate the ownership of the opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the\n        opportunity for the benefit of the project.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Another response strategy for both threats or opportunities is to <b>Accept</b>: Decide to live with the risk, and\n    define a contingency plan.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Some scenarios for software development may help to make these concepts more clear:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        You need to use a new framework. A risk avoidance strategy could be to drop this new framework and use another one\n        that is already understood by the team.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The application you are developing needs to communicate with a legacy system. A risk transfer strategy would be to\n        have the legacy support team be responsible for providing the APIs to access the legacy system.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        You need to use new middleware. A risk mitigation strategy could be to build a prototype using this new middleware\n        to validate that it will provide the features you need for your application.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Your integrator is the only one who knows how to integrate the different components of your application. A\n        contingency plan could be to identify a resource on another project that you could bring on if your integrator is\n        sick, leaves the company, and so on.\n    </li>\n</ul>"

                      "<h3>\n    Agile Estimation\n</h3>\n<p>\n    There are three main concepts you need to understand to do agile estimation, see [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#COH05\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">COH05</a>] for more information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Estimation of Size</strong> gives a high-level estimate for the work item, typically measured using a\n        neutral unit such as points\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Velocity</strong> tells us how many points this project team can deliver within an iteration;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Estimation of Effort</strong> translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort\n        typically using the units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. The estimation of effort indicates how long it will take\n        the team member(s) to complete the assigned work item(s).\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Estimation of Size\n</h4>\n<p>\n    <strong>Points</strong> is a relative measure that can be used for agile estimation of size.&nbsp;The team decides how\n    big a point is, and based on that size, determines how many points each work item is. To make estimation go fast, use\n    only full points, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on, rather than fractions of a point, such 0.25, or 1.65 points. To get\n    started, look at 10 or so representative work items, give the smallest the size of one point, and then go through all\n    other work items and give them a relative point estimate based on that point. Note that points are used for high-level\n    estimates, so do not spend too much time on any one item. This is especially true for work items of lower priority, to\n    avoid wasting effort on things that are unlikely to be addressed within the current iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A key benefit of points is that they are neutral and relative. Let's say that Ann is 3 times more productive than Jack.\n    If Ann and Jack agree that work item A is worth 1 point, and they both think work item B is roughly 5 times as big,\n    they can rapidly agree that work item B is worth 5 points. Ann may however think work item B can be done in 12 hours,\n    while Jack thinks it can be done in 36 hours. That is fine, they may disagree about the actual effort required to do\n    it, but we do not care at this point in time, we only want the team to agree on the relative size. We will later use\n    Velocity to determine how much 'size', or how many points, the team can take on within an iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    One project team may say that a work item of a certain size is worth 1 point. Another project team would estimate the\n    same sized work item to be worth 5 points. That is fine, as long as you are consistent within the same project. Make\n    sure that the entire team is involved in assessing size, or at least that the same people are involved in all your size\n    estimates, to ensure consistency within your project. We will see how the concept of velocity will fix also this\n    discrepancy in a point meaning different things to different project teams.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You can also use other measures of size, where the most common alternative is Ideal Days. See for example [<a\n    class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">COH05</a>] for more information.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Velocity\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Velocity is a key metric used for iteration planning. It indicates how many points are delivered upon within an\n    iteration for a certain team and project. As an example, a team planned to accomplish 20 points in the first iteration.\n    At the end of the iteration, they noticed that they only delivered upon 14 points, their velocity was hence 14. For the\n    next iteration, they may plan for fewer points, let's say 18 points, since they think they can do a little better than\n    in previous iteration. In this iteration, they delivered 17 points, giving them a velocity of 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Expect the velocity to change from iteration to iteration. Some iterations go smoother than others, and points are not\n    always identical in terms of effort. Some team members are more effective than others, and some problems end up being\n    harder than others. Also, changes to the team structure, learning new skills, changes to the tool environment, better\n    teaming, or more overhead with meetings or tasks external to the project will all impact velocity. In general, velocity\n    typically increases during the project as the team builds skills and becomes more cohesive.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Velocity compensates for differences between teams in terms of how big a point is. Let's assume that project team Alpha\n    and project team Beta are equally efficient in developing software, and they run the same project in parallel. Team\n    Alpha, however, assesses all work items as being worth 3 times as many points as team Beta's estimates. Team Alpha\n    assesses work item A, B, C, and D to correspond to 30 points, and team Beta estimates the same work items to correspond\n    to 10 points. Both teams deliver upon those 4 work items in the next iteration, giving team Alpha a velocity of 30, and\n    team Beta a velocity of 10. It may sound as if team Alpha is more effective, but let's look at what happens when they\n    plan the next iteration. They both want to take on work item E-H, which team Alpha has estimated to be 30 points, and\n    team Beta as normal has estimated to be 1/3 as many points, or 10 points. Since a team can typically take on as many\n    points as indicated by their velocity, they can both take on all of E-H. The end result is that it does not matter how\n    big a point is, as long as you are consistent within your team.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Velocity also averages out the efficiency of different team members. Let's look at an example; Let's assume that Ann\n    always works 3 times as fast as Jack and Jane. Ann will perhaps deliver 9 points per iteration, and Jack and Jane 3\n    points each per iteration. The velocity of that 3-person team will be 15 points. As mentioned above, Ann and Jack may\n    not agree on how much effort is associated with a work item, but they can agree on how many points it is worth. Since\n    the team velocity is 15, the velocity will automatically translate the point estimate to how much work can be taken on.\n    As you switch team members, or as team members become more or less efficient, your velocity will change, and you can\n    hence take on more or less points. This does however not require you to change the estimate of the size. The size is\n    still the same, and the velocity will help you to calculate how much size you can deliver upon with the team at hand\n    for that iteration.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Estimation of Effort\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Estimation of Effort translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort typically using the\n    units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. As you plan an iteration, you will take on a work item, such as detail, design,\n    implement and test a scenario, which may be sized to 5 points. Since this is still a reasonably big work item, break it\n    down&nbsp;into a number of smaller work items, such as 4 separate work items for Detailing, Designing, Implementing and\n    Testing Server portion, and Implementing and Testing Client portion of the scenario. Team members are asked to sign up\n    for the tasks, and then detail the&nbsp;estimate of the actual effort, measured in hours or days, for their tasks. In\n    this case, the following actual estimates were done (with person responsible within parenthesis):\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Detailing scenario (Ann): 4 hours\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Designing scenario (Ann and Jack):&nbsp; 6 hours\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Implementing and Testing Server portion of scenario (Jack): 22 hours&nbsp;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Implementing and Testing Client portion of scenario (Ann): 12 hours\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Total Effort Estimate for Scenario:</strong> 44 hours\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    If other people would be assigned to the tasks, the estimated actual hours could be quite different. There is hence no\n    point doing detailed estimates until you know who will do the work, and what actual problems you will run into. Often,\n    some level of analysis and design of the work item needs to take place before a reasonable estimate can be done.\n    Remember that estimates are still estimates, and a person assigned to a task should feel free (and be encouraged) to\n    re-estimate the effort required to complete the task, so we have a realistic view of progress within an iteration.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction to Risk Management\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Every project contains some measure of uncertainty. <strong>Risk Management</strong>&nbsp;deals with this uncertainty,\n    trying to understand its&nbsp;potential influence on the project. The purpose of Risk Management is to increase the\n    probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of events adverse to the project [<a\n    class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html\"\n    guid=\"_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig\">PMI</a>]. The project manager, team, and stakeholders should be involved in risk\n    management.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Identify Risks\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Identify risks as soon as the project starts and document them in the risk list.&nbsp;Continue identifying and managing\n    risks throughout the project. A common mistake is to identify risks only at the beginning of the project and then only\n    track the status of these initial risks. Revisit the risk list weekly, or as a minimum when performing iteration\n    planning,&nbsp;and add any newly discovered risks to the list.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Prioritize Risks\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Prioritize risks for further analysis or action. A good approach for prioritizing risks is to have an attribute called\n    risk magnitude, a combination of the risk probability and the risk impact. Each iteration provides a chance&nbsp;for\n    better understanding of stakeholder needs, the team capabilities, the technology at hand, and so on. Capture, qualify\n    and prioritize risks as they arise. High magnitude risks are&nbsp;attacked first, thus&nbsp;improving the chances of\n    project success and minimizing uncertainty.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Select Risk Response Strategies\n</h3>\n<p>\n    You are trying to mitigate or tackle the high priority risks as early as possible in the project. In order to achieve\n    this you need to get a good grip on the risks the project is faced with, and have clear strategies on how to mitigate\n    or deal with them.&nbsp; Once you have chosen a set of risks to focus on, develop options and determine actions to\n    enhance opportunities and reduce threats, selecting a strategy, as described in <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/risk_AF5840DA.html\"\n    guid=\"_0bsLgMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Concept: Risk</a>. Sometimes strategies can be determined for each cause, rather than\n    each risk, eliminating many risks at once.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Plan Risk Response\n</h3>\n<p>\n    For each selected strategy, identify and assign tasks to apply the strategy to the given risk. Place those tasks on the\n    work items list&nbsp;so they can be assigned to iterations. Keep a&nbsp;reference to the risk for traceability. The\n    effort must be appropriate to the magnitude of the risk. Avoid spending more preventing a threat than the impact from\n    the risk if it occurs.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Monitor Risks\n</h3>\n<p id=\"comment_text_4\">\n    Follow up regularly on risk-mitigation actions. Risk reviews should be held&nbsp;when&nbsp;assessing the results during\n    a project milestone to determine whether the information about project risks is up to date, and to assess whether any\n    changes are necessary. The team may decide to try another strategy if the chosen strategy does not reduce/increase the\n    magnitude of a risk.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Planning transition iterations\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Software may be deployed into a production environment at the end of any Construction or Transition iteration.\n    Deployment to production before the end of the project may be done to drive down risk by validating the application,\n    deployment scripts, deployment environment, and to get valuable feedback from operations and systems teams, as well as\n    end users. These early deployments are often done on a limited scale in terms of target audience or only partial\n    applications are deployed. For the deployment to work, one or several iterations are focused on work necessary to\n    successfully release the system. In the Transition phase, one or several iterations may be dedicated to preparing for a\n    smooth deployment. The number of iterations depends on the complexity of the system and various other factors, as\n    listed here. When planning for deployment, the Work Items list should be updated with relevant tasks related to these\n    considerations:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Resolving defects\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Testing installation or deployment scripts to avoid surprises in actual deployment&nbsp;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Updating any&nbsp;operations&nbsp;and support test environments used to simulate production problems\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Performing release-specific testing efforts, such as pilot or beta testing,to a subset of your end-user community\n        where the system is deployed\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Conducting acceptance reviews with stakeholders, including a&nbsp;final release acceptance testing effort where\n        people outside of the team are involved and decide whether it truly meets their needs\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Finalizing relevant documentation, such as operations and system manuals, end-user documentation and release notes\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Creating&nbsp;physical collateral, such as installation media\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Replacing or installing physical assets, or both, including workstations, servers, and network components\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Replacing existing software with new versions\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Updating existing databases, including any relevant data migration and database schema changes\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Production data population\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Training end users and operations&nbsp;and support staff\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Fixing any discrepancies discovered during the transition phase\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Setting up management and operational systems and processes\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Training the team that is taking over maintenance and evolution of the system\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Deploying the software to the production environment\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    When the team and stakeholders are reviewing late Construction and early Transition iterations, the team should gather\n    feedback from actual stakeholders' use of the product and take that information into consideration when prioritizing\n    the work for the next iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    See [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#AMB07\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">AMB07</a>]&nbsp; for more information.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Reviewing transition iterations\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Transition iteration reviews have a different focus from other iterations in the project lifecycle.

To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items\n    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case\n    scenario for&nbsp;\"Calculate Net Worth\". Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to\n    developers, such as \"Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth\".

These correspond to specific goals that the actor has in using the\n    system.&nbsp;\n</p><br />\n<p>\n    <img height=\"321\" alt=\"Figure 1: ATM Use-Case Example\" src=\"core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/resources/fig1_atm_ex.gif\" width=\"456\" />\n</p>\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n    <blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n        <p>\n            Figure 1: ATM Use-Case Example\n        </p>\n    </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Each use case is associated with a goal of one of the actors. The collection of use cases constitutes all the possible\n    ways of using the system. You should be able to determine the goal of a use case simply by observing its name.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A use case describes the interactions between the actor(s) and the system in the form of a dialog between the actor(s)\n    and the system, structured as follows:\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        The actor &lt;&lt;does something&gt;&gt;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system &lt;&lt;does something in response&gt;&gt;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The actor &lt;&lt;does something else&gt;&gt;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system ...\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n    Each dialog of this form is called a \"Flow of Events\".\n</p>\n<p>\n    Because there are many flows of events possible for achieving the goal (for example, the flow may differ depending upon\n    specific input from the actor), and there are situations in which the goal cannot be achieved (for example, a required\n    network connection is currently unavailable), each use case will contain several flows, including one \"Basic Flow of\n    Events\" and several \"Alternative Flows\".\n</p>\n<p>\n    The Basic Flow of Events specifies the interactions between the actor(s) and the system for the ideal case, where\n    everything goes as planned, and the actor's goal (the observable result of value) is met. The basic flow represents the\n    main capability provided by the system for this use case.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As the name implies, Alternative Flows specify alternative interactions associated with the same goal.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Closely related to use cases is the concept of a scenario. A scenario is a <em><strong>specific</strong></em> flow of\n    events, for a <em><strong>specific</strong></em> set of inputs to the system, states of the system, and states of the\n    system's environment. Scenarios are closely related to test cases.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Properties of Use Cases\n</h3>\n<h4>\n    <a id=\"Name\" name=\"Name\">Name</a>\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Each use case should have a name that indicates what is achieved by its interaction with the actors. The name may have\n    to be several words to be understood. Note: No two use cases can have the same name.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    <a id=\"Brief Description\" name=\"Brief Description\">Brief Description</a>\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The brief description of the use case should reflect its purpose.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Flow of Events\n</h4>\n<h5>\n    <a id=\"Flow of Events - Contents\" name=\"Flow of Events - Contents\">Flow of Events - Contents</a>\n</h5>\n<p>\n    The flow of events should describe the use case's flow of events clearly enough for an outsider to easily understand.\n    Remember, the flow of events should represent <em>what</em> the system does, not <em>how</em> the system is design to\n    perform the required behavior.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Follow these guidelines for the contents of the flow of events:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Describe how the use case starts and ends.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Describe what data is exchanged between the actor and the use case.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Do not describe the details of the user interface, unless it is necessary to understand the behavior of the\n        system.&nbsp;Specifying user interface details too early will limit design options.&nbsp;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Describe the flow of events, not only the functionality. To enforce this, start every action with \"When the actor\n        ... \".\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Describe only the events that belong to the use case, and not what happens in other use cases or outside of the\n        system.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Avoid vague terminology.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Detail the flow of events. Specify what happens when, for each action. Remember this text will be used to identify\n        test cases.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    If you have used certain terms in other use cases, be sure to use the exact same terms in this use case, and\n    that&nbsp;the meaning of the terms is consistent. To manage common terms, put them in a glossary.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    <a id=\"Flow of Events - Structure\" name=\"Flow of Events - Structure\">Flow of Events - Structure</a>\n</h5>\n<p>\n    The two main parts of the flow of events are <b>basic flow of events</b> and <b>alternative flows of events</b>. The\n    basic flow of events should cover what \"normally\" happens when the use case is performed. The alternative flows of\n    events cover behavior of optional or exceptional character in relation to the normal behavior, and also variations of\n    the normal behavior. You can think of the alternative flows of events as detours from the basic flow of events, some of\n    which will return to the basic flow of events and some of which will end the execution of the use case.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The straight arrow in Figure 2 represents the basic flow of events, and the curves represent alternative paths in\n    relation to the normal. Some alternative paths return to the basic flow of events, whereas others end the use case.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img height=\"212\" alt=\"Diagram described in caption.\" src=\"core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/resources/ucstrct.gif\" width=\"231\" />&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    Figure 2: Typical structure of a use case flow of events\n</p>\n<p class=\"picturetext\">\n    Both the basic and alternative flows should be further structured into steps or sub-flows. In doing this, your main\n    goal should be readability of the text. A&nbsp;guideline is that a sub-flow should be a segment of behavior within the\n    use case that has a clear purpose, and is \"atomic\" in the sense that you do either all or none of the actions\n    described.\n</p>\n<h4 class=\"picturetext\">\n    <a id=\"Special Requirements\" name=\"Special Requirements\">Special Requirements</a>\n</h4>\n<p>\n    In the Special Requirements of a use case, you describe all the requirements associated with&nbsp;the use case that are\n    not covered by the flow of events. These are non-functional requirements that will influence the design. See also the\n    discussion on non-functional requirements in <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/requirements_8006414F.html\"\n    guid=\"_0Wh-sMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Concept: Requirements</a>.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    <a id=\"preconditions and Postconditions\" name=\"preconditions and Postconditions\">Preconditions and Post-conditions</a>\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A <strong>precondition</strong> is the state of the system and its&nbsp;environment that is required before the use\n    case can be started.&nbsp;Post-Conditions are&nbsp;the states the system can be in after the use case has ended. It can\n    be&nbsp;helpful to use the&nbsp;concepts of <b>precondition</b> and <b>post-condition</b> to clarify how the flow of\n    events starts and ends. However, only use them only if the audience for the description of the use case agrees that it\n    is helpful. Figure 3 shows an example.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img height=\"278\" alt=\"Diagram described in caption.\" src=\"core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/resources/ucprepst.gif\" width=\"344\" />\n</p><br class=\"picturetext\" />\n<br />\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n    <blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n        <blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n            <p>\n                Figure 3: Illustration of preconditions and resulting post-conditions\n            </p>\n        </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"exampleheading\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    Examples\n</p>\n<p class=\"example\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    <strong>A precondition for the use case Cash Withdrawal in the ATM machine:</strong> The customer has a personally\n    issued card that fits in the card reader, has been issued a PIN number, and is registered with the banking system.\n</p>\n<p class=\"example\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n    <strong>A post-condition for the use case Cash Withdrawal in the ATM machine:</strong> At the end of the use case, all\n    account and transaction logs are balanced, communication with the banking system is reinitialized and the card is\n    returned to the customer.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Explanation\n</h3>\n<p>\n    A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system to solve a problem.&nbsp; As such,\n    it describes the goals of the users, the interactions between the users and the system, and the required behavior of\n    the system in satisfying these goals.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A use-case model consists of a number of model elements.&nbsp; The most important model elements are: use cases, actors\n    and the relationships between them.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    A use-case diagram is used to graphically depict a subset of the model to simplify communications.&nbsp; There will\n    typically be several use-case diagrams associated with a given model, each showing a subset of the model elements\n    relevant for a particular purpose.&nbsp; The same model element may be shown on several use-case diagrams, but each\n    instance must be consistent.&nbsp; If tools are used to maintain the use-case model, this consistency constraint is\n    automated so that any changes to the model element (changing the name for example) will be automatically reflected on\n    every use-case diagram that shows that element.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The use-case model may contain packages that are used to structure the model to simplify analysis, communications,\n    navigation, development, maintenance and planning.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Much of the use-case model is in fact textual, with the text captured in the&nbsp;use-case specifications&nbsp;that are\n    associated with each use-case model element.&nbsp;These specifications describe the flow of events of the use case.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The use-case model serves as a unifying thread throughout system development. It is used as the primary specification\n    of the functional requirements for the system, as the basis for analysis and design, as an input to iteration planning,\n    as the basis of defining test cases and as the basis for user documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Basic model elements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The use-case model contains, as a minimum, the following basic model elements.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Actor\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A model element representing&nbsp;each actor. Properties include the actors name and brief description. See&nbsp;<a\n    class=\"elementLinkWithType\" href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/actor_411726C.html\"\n    guid=\"_zGqO0MDpEduTGJ8i4u8TMw\">Concept: Actor</a> for more information.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Use Case\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A model element representing&nbsp;each use case. Properties include the use case name and use case specification.\n    See&nbsp;Use Case artifact and <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/use_case_BB199D1B.html\"\n    guid=\"_KudM0NcJEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q\">Concept: Use Case</a> for more information.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Associations\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Associations are used to describe the relationships between actors and the use cases they participate in. This\n    relationship is commonly known as a \"communicates-association\".\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Advanced model elements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The use-case model may also contain the following advanced model elements.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Subject\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A model element that represents the boundary of the system of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Use-Case Package\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A model element used to structure the use case model to simplify analysis, communications, navigation, and\n    planning.&nbsp; If there are many use cases or actors, you can use use-case packages to further structure the use-case\n    model in much the same manner you use folders or directories to structure the information on your hard-disk.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You can partition a use-case model into use-case packages for several reasons, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        To reflect the order, configuration, or delivery units in the finished system thus supporting iteration planning.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        To support parallel development by dividing the problem into bite-sized pieces.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        To simplify communication with different stakeholders by creating packages for containing use cases and actors\n        relevant to a particular stakeholder.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Generalizations\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A relationship&nbsp;between actors to support re-use of common properties.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Dependencies\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A number of dependency types between use cases are defined in UML. In particular, &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; and\n    &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;.\n</p>\n<p>\n    &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; is used to include optional behavior from an extending use case in an extended use case.\n</p>\n<p>\n    &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; is used to include common behavior from an included use case into a base use case in order to\n    support re-use of common behavior.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The latter is the most widely used dependency and is useful for:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Factoring out behavior from the base use case that is not necessary for the understanding of the primary purpose of\n        the use case to simplify communications.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Factoring out behavior that is in common for two or more use cases to maximize re-use, simplify maintenance and\n        ensure consistency.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Example Use-Case Diagram\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Figure 1 shows a use-case diagram from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) use-case model.\n</p>\n<p>\n    &nbsp;<img alt=\"Figure 1: ATM Use-Case Diagram\" src=\"core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/resources/atm_uc_diagram.gif\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n    Figure 1: ATM Use-Case Diagram\n</p>\n<p>\n    This diagram shows the subject (atm:ATM), four actors (Bank Customer, Bank, Cashier and Maintenance Person), five use\n    cases (Withdraw Cash, Transfer Funds, Deposit Funds, Refill Machine and Validate User), three &lt;&lt;includes&gt;&gt;\n    dependencies, and the associations between the performing actors and the use cases.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The use cases Withdraw Cash, Deposit Funds, and Transfer Funds all need to include how the customer is identified to\n    the system. This behavior can be extracted to a new inclusion use case called Validate User, which the three base use\n    cases &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;. The base use cases are independent of the method used for identification, and it is\n    therefore encapsulated in the inclusion use case. From the perspective of the base use cases, it does not matter\n    whether the method for identification is to read a magnetic bank card, or perform a retinal scan. They only depend on\n    the result of Validate Customer.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Note that Figure 1 is only a partial view of the use-case model. The complete use-case model also includes descriptions\n    of each actor, descriptions of each use case, and use-case specifications for each use case.&nbsp; For a more complete\n    example of this use case model see&nbsp;<a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/examples/uc_model_evolve_960F136B.html\"\n    guid=\"_t4QdAMNqEdu2IdAIaWZyAw\">Evolution of the Use-Case Model</a>.<br />\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    During testing, you will encounter failures related to the execution of your tests in different forms, such as code\n    defects, user errors, program malfunctions, and general problems. This&nbsp;concept discusses some ways to conduct\n    failure analysis and then to report your findings.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Failure Analysis\n</h3>\n<p>\n    After you have run your tests, it is good practice to identify inputs for review of the results of the testing effort.\n    Some likely sources are defects that occurred during the execution of test scripts, change request metrics, and test\n    log details.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Running test scripts results in errors of different kinds such as uncovered defects, unexpected behavior, or general\n    failure of the test script to run properly. When you run test scripts, one of the most important things to do is to\n    identify causes and effects of failure. It is important to differentiate failures in the system under test&nbsp;from\n    those related to the tests themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Change request metrics are useful in analyzing and correcting failures in the testing. Select metrics that will\n    facilitate creation of incident reports from a collection of change requests.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Change request metrics that you may find useful in your failure analysis include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        test coverage\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        priority\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        impact\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        defect trends\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        density\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Finally, one of the most critical sources of your failure analysis is the test log. Start by gathering the test log's\n    output during the implementation and execution of the tests. Relevant logs might come from many sources; they might be\n    captured by the tools you use (both test execution and diagnostic tools), generated by custom-written routines your\n    team has developed, output from the target test items themselves, and recorded manually be the tester. Gather all of\n    the available test log sources and examine their content. Check that all the scheduled testing executed to completion,\n    and that all the needed tests&nbsp;have been scheduled.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Self-Documenting Tests\n</h3>\n<p>\n    For automated tests it is a best practice for the test itself to examine the results and clearly report itself as\n    passing or failing. This provides the most efficient way to run tests such that whole suites of tests can be run with\n    each test in turn determining whether it has passed or failed without the need for human intervention. When authoring\n    self-documenting tests, take extra care to ensure that the analysis of the results considers all possibilities.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Recording Your Findings\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Once you have conducted your failure analysis, you may decide to formalize the results of this analysis by recording\n    your findings in a report. There are several factors that go into deciding whether to record your failure analysis in a\n    report. Some of the key factors include: level of testing formality, complexity of the testing effort, and the need to\n    communicate the testing results to the entire development team. In less formal environments, it may be sufficient to\n    record your failure analysis in&nbsp;a test evaluation summary.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    There is much more to testing computer software than simply evaluating the functions, interface, and response-time\n    characteristics of a target-of-test.&nbsp;Additional tests must focus on characteristics and attributes, such as the\n    target-of-test.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        integrity (resistance to failure)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        ability to be installed and executed on different platforms\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        ability to handle many requests simultaneously\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    To achieve this, many different types of tests are implemented and executed.&nbsp;Each test type has a specific\n    objective and support technique.&nbsp;Each technique focuses on testing one or more characteristics or attributes of\n    the target-of-test.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The following sections list the types of test based on the most obvious quality&nbsp;attributes they address.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Types of test for&nbsp;Functionality\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <strong>Function test:</strong>&nbsp;Tests focused on validating the target-of-test functions as intended, providing\n    the required services, methods, or use cases. This test is implemented and executed against different targets-of-test,\n    including units, integrated units, applications, and systems.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Security test:</strong>&nbsp;Tests focused on ensuring the target-of-test data (or systems) are accessible only\n    to those actors for which they are intended. This test is implemented and executed on various targets-of-test.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Volume test:</strong>&nbsp;Tests focused on verifying the target-of-test's ability to handle large amounts of\n    data, either as input and output or resident within the database.&nbsp;Volume testing includes test strategies such as\n    creating queries that would return the entire contents of the database, or that would have so many restrictions that no\n    data is returned, or where the data entry has the maximum amount of data for each field.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Types of test for&nbsp;Usability\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <strong>Usability test:</strong>&nbsp;Tests that focus on:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        human factors\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        esthetics\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        consistency in the user interface\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        online and context-sensitive help\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        wizards and agents\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        user documentation\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        training materials\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    <strong>Integrity test:</strong>&nbsp;Tests that focus on assessing the target-of-test's robustness (resistance to\n    failure), and technical compliance to language, syntax, and resource usage.&nbsp;This test is implemented and executed\n    against different targets-of-tests, including units and integrated units.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Structure test</strong>: Tests that focus on assessing the target-of-test's adherence to its design and\n    formation.&nbsp;Typically, this test is done for Web-enabled applications ensuring that all links are connected,\n    appropriate content is displayed, and no content is orphaned.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Types of test for&nbsp;Reliability\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <strong>Stress test:</strong>&nbsp; A type of reliability test that focuses on evaluating how the system responds under\n    abnormal conditions.&nbsp;Stresses on the system could include extreme workloads, insufficient memory, unavailable\n    services and hardware, or limited shared resources.&nbsp;These tests are often performed to gain a better understanding\n    of how and in what areas the system will break, so that contingency plans and upgrade maintenance can be planned and\n    budgeted for well in advance.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Benchmark test:</strong>&nbsp; A type of performance test that compares the performance of a new or unknown\n    target-of-test to a known reference-workload and system.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Contention test:</strong>&nbsp; Tests focused on validating the target-of-test's ability to acceptably handle\n    multiple actor demands on the same resource (data records, memory, and so on).\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Types of test for Performance\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <strong>Load test:</strong>&nbsp; A type of performance test used to validate and assess acceptability of the\n    operational limits of a system under varying workloads while the system-under-test remains constant.&nbsp;In some\n    variants, the workload remains constant and the configuration of the system-under-test is varied.&nbsp; Measurements\n    are usually taken based on the workload throughout and in-line transaction response time.&nbsp;The variations in\n    workload usually include emulation of average and peak workloads that occur within normal operational tolerances.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Performance profile:</strong> A test in which the target-of-test's timing profile is monitored, including\n    execution flow, data access, function and system calls to identify and address both performance bottlenecks and\n    inefficient processes.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Configuration test:</strong>&nbsp; Tests focused on ensuring the target-of-test functions as intended on\n    different hardware and software configurations.&nbsp;This test might also be implemented as a system performance test.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Types of test for Supportability\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <strong>Installation test:</strong>&nbsp; Tests focused on ensuring the target-of-test installs as intended on\n    different hardware and software configurations, and under different conditions (such as insufficient disk space or\n    power interruptions).&nbsp;This test is implemented and executed against applications and systems.\n</p>"

For example, when testing a user interface, a developer might follow a\r\n    script, explaining the implementation element. In this case, it is still valuable to create a test harness that goes\r\n    straight to the user interface. That way, the developer can follow the script without having to follow a complicated\r\n    set of instructions to find a particular screen or page.\r\n</p>\r\n<h4>\r\n    Option: Embedded code\r\n</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n    You can use certain technologies (such as Java(TM)5 Test Annotation) to embed tests in the implementation. In these\r\n    cases, there will be a logical work product, but it will be assimilated into the code that you are testing. When you\r\n    use this option, ensure that the code is self-documenting.\r\n</p>"

                          "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    At some point in your test effort, you may find it necessary to manage your test effort by creating test suites for\n    your test assets.&nbsp;Maintaining test suites can take many different forms. To facilitate your testing, you may want\n    to introduce some&nbsp;level of&nbsp;automation of your test suites.&nbsp;The fact that you've automated your test\n    suites does not necessarily make your testing easier however. It may actually increase the maintenance burden of your\n    suites.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This guideline introduces you to useful heuristics on how to facilitate the maintenance of your automated test suites.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Plan your test&nbsp;suites\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Automating your testing without planning increases&nbsp;the chances that testing will be ineffective\n    and&nbsp;inefficient.&nbsp;Some level of planning should take place whether implicit or explicit.&nbsp;An essential\n    part of any test plan is the definition of a strategy for test automation.&nbsp;Use your plan to articulate to the\n    development team how you plan to maintain your test assets.&nbsp;In many cases, this is never done.&nbsp;The rest of\n    the development team may be unaware of how you intend to maintain your tests.&nbsp;It is also a good practice to get\n    the rest of the development team to understand that this maintenance can be a substantial part of the overall\n    development effort.&nbsp;Use your test tooling to capture this information and treat this plan just like you would\n    treat any other test asset in your test repository.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Centrally locate your test assets\n</h4>\n<p>\n    To facilitate the maintenance of your automated test suites, locate your test assets in a repository that can be\n    accessed by the development team.&nbsp;Many test automation environments provide test management tools that make it\n    easier to organize and access your test assets by maintaining the test assets (test cases, test scripts, and test\n    suites) in a common repository.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In addition, some form of access control is enforced by the automation test tool.&nbsp;This eases the maintenance\n    burden by ensuring the integrity of your test suites.&nbsp;You may choose to grant stakeholders and managers read-only\n    access, whereas developers and testers at the practitioner level may have read/write access.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Treat your test assets like any other software\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Software must be maintained.&nbsp;This also applies to the software in your test suites.&nbsp;Test cases and their\n    associated test scripts, whether recorded or programmed, should be maintained.&nbsp;And just as software has different\n    kinds of maintenance (e.g., corrective, preventative, or adaptive) so too do the assets in your automated test suites.\n    As you lifecycle your test suites, identify, if only informally,&nbsp;how&nbsp;you plan to disposition the test suite\n    corrective maintenance (e.g., syntactical errors in your scripts),&nbsp;preventative maintenance (e.g., where possible\n    to write generalized test scripts), and adaptive maintenance (e.g., how you&nbsp;can use your test tooling to re-assign\n    test&nbsp;assets within one suite to&nbsp;another suite or suites).&nbsp;This can be captured, as described in the\n    section <strong>Plan Your Test Suites</strong> above, in your test plan.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Improve the testability of your test suites through collaboration with developers\n</h4>\n<p>\n    It's one thing to say that your test suites will need to be maintained due to changes in the application, changes in\n    the testing target, etc.&nbsp;It's quite another thing to actually determine whether a test suite needs to be\n    revamped&nbsp;and, if it does, what test assets within it need to be addressed.\n</p>\n<p>\n    One way to facilitate this is to use test suites as a way to communicate test decision to the developers.&nbsp;One way\n    to perform continuous perfective maintenance of test suites is to think of your test suites as assets that belong to\n    the development team rather than just the testers.&nbsp; You can perform a kind of perfective maintenance on test in\n    the following ways:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        use test suites to raise the level of abstraction\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        use test suites to provide focus for the developer\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        use test suites to articulate areas that the developers would like testers to focus on\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        make the construction and maintenance&nbsp;of test suites more efficient&nbsp;by understanding what area(s)\n        developers want to focus on\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        use test suites to clarify test targets with developers\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Don't be afraid to clean up your suites\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Your test assets will evolve just as the application under test will.&nbsp;As requirements to the system change, the\n    application will change as well.&nbsp;To maintain your test suites, you should continually&nbsp;check whether test\n    assets are valid.&nbsp;If possible, validity checks should be performed after each new release of the software,\n    preferably more frequently.&nbsp;Keeping your test suites relevant is a full-time job.&nbsp;Assume that changes in the\n    software will lead to some degree of invalid tests within your test suites.&nbsp;Once these test assets have been\n    identified as invalid, get rid of them.&nbsp;This will make the maintenance burden much more tolerable.&nbsp;Some\n    automated test tooling environments make this task easier by providing ways to package outdated or invalid\n    tests.&nbsp;In some cases, you may not be absolutely sure whether you want to completely get rid of tests within your\n    test suite or even of getting rid of test suites altogether.&nbsp; To alleviate this burden, you can create packages\n    for obsolete tests or test suites and dispose of tests or test suites by putting them in packages labeled for this\n    purpose.\n</p>"

                          "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Although the programming of automated tests should contribute to the overall test effort, it usually does not make up\n    the entire test effort. In fact, test environments that are based on a complete automation approach end up spending\n    more time on test automation than on testing. Before you begin the development of&nbsp;automated test scripts, consider\n    first whether it is more efficient to perform manual testing. Some aspects of an application are more efficiently\n    tested manually (for example, GUI testing versus data-drive testing). If you decide to program automated test scripts,\n    examine what aspects of your test scripting can be automated and begin designing your scripts.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Design your automated tests\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Without some level of design of your automated tests, introducing automation into your testing effort can lead to more\n    problems than it solves. You should consider developing your automated tests according to a lifecycle with automation\n    test requirements, design, testing of the automation tests, and implementation of the automation tests. This approach\n    can be informal or formal depending on your project needs. By designing the programming of your automated tests, you\n    can avoid spending time programming the wrong tests, re-working programmed tests, deciphering different coding styles\n    in the programming of the tests, etc.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Recorded versus programmed scripts\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Although there are clear benefits to recorded scripts (for example, ease of creation or ability for novice testers to\n    learn a scripting language), recorded scripts also present their own problems. The disadvantages of playback scripts\n    are well known. They are deceptively easy to create but very difficult to update. Problems with script reliability,\n    hard-coded data values, or changes to the application under test and the need to re-record are well-documented. On the\n    other hand, programming scripts can present difficulties of their own: they are difficult for the novice tester to\n    create, they can require substantial time and effort to develop, and they can be difficult to debug. Most test tooling\n    makes these issues less problematic by providing the tester script support functions, such as ways to establish target\n    of test lists, systematic ways to program verification point, point to datapools, build commands into the script (for\n    example, sleeper commands), comment the script, and document the script. Another major advantage, which is often\n    overlooked, of using testing tooling to mitigate these risks is the ability to add to an existing script in the form of\n    making corrections to an existing script, testing new features of a test target or application under test, or resuming\n    a recording after an interruption.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Functional and performance test scripts\n</h3>\n<p>\n    When discussing automating test scripts, it is important to distinguish between functional and performance tests. Most\n    discussions of programming automated test scripts focus on testing the functionality of an application. This is not\n    inappropriate, since a lot of automated testing focuses on functional testing. Performance test scripting, however, has\n    its unique characteristics. Performance test automation provides you with the ability to programmatically set workloads\n    by adding user groups to test loads under group usage, setting think time behavior, running tests randomly or at set\n    rates, or setting the duration of a run. Performance test automation also allows you to create and maintain schedules\n    for your tests.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Testing test scripts\n</h3>\n<p>\n    When testing your test scripts, keep in mind whether you are testing recorded or programmed test scripts. For recorded\n    scripts, much of the debugging of the script consists of errors that are introduced due to changes in the test target\n    or test environment. When you run a recorded test script, consider the test target of the script. Some test automation\n    tools capture this information as a part of the test script. Debugging a recorded script consists largely of\n    determining whether changes in the target have created error conditions in the script. In general, there are two main\n    categories to examine here: changes in the UI and test session sensitive data (for example, date stamped data). In most\n    cases, discrepancies between recording and playback cause errors in your recorded test scripts.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Testing programmed test scripts involves many of the same debugging techniques you would apply to debugging an\n    application. Consider both the flow control logic and the data aspects of your script. Automated testing tools provide\n    you with test script debugging IDEs as well as datapool management features that facilitate this type of testing.\n    During execution of test scripts, a test that uses a datapool can replace values in the programmed test with variable\n    test data that is stored in the datapool.\n</p>"

                          "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Test ideas are used to generate tests.&nbsp;Test ideas can come from many different sources.&nbsp;In general, they can\n    be derived in different ways depending on the given development domain, the kind of application being developed, and\n    the sophistication of the testers.&nbsp;Although test ideas are derived in many different ways, there are some useful\n    categories for generating them.&nbsp;This guideline will describe some of these categories as well as some general\n    heuristics for creating good test ideas.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Test Ideas and Functions\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Below are some test ideas to calculate the square root:\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        A number that's barely less than zero as input\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Zero as the input\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Number that's a perfect square, like 4 or 16 (is the result exactly 2 or 4?)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Print to a LaserJet IIIp\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Test with database full\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n    The first&nbsp;3 test ideas validate input while the last 2 address environmental issues.&nbsp; Even though these\n    statements are very incomplete they ensure that an idea is not forgotten.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Test Ideas and Boundaries\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Test ideas are often based on fault models.&nbsp; Consider boundaries. It's safe to assume the square root function can\n    be implemented something like this:<br />\n    <!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n    double sqrt(double x) {<br />\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (x &lt; 0)<br />\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // signal error<br />\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br />\n    <!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n    It's also plausible that the &lt; will be incorrectly typed as &lt;=. People often make that kind of mistake, so it's\n    worth checking. The fault cannot be detected with X having the value 2, because both the incorrect expression (x&lt;=0)\n    and the correct expression (x&lt;0) will take the same branch of the if statement. Similarly, giving X the value -5\n    cannot find the fault. The only way to find it is to give X the value 0, which justifies the second test idea.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Test Idea and Methods\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Let's suppose you're designing tests for a method that searches for a string in a sequential collection. It can either\n    obey case or ignore case in its search, and it returns the index of the first match found or -1 if no match is\n    found.<br />\n    int Collection.find(String string, Boolean ignoreCase);\n</p>\n<p>\n    Here are some test ideas for this method, each of which could be implemented as a test.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Match found in the first position\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Match found in the last position\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        No match found\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Two or more matches found in the collection\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Case is ignored; match found, but it wouldn't match if case was obeyed\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Case is obeyed; an exact match is found\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Case is obeyed; a string that would have matched if case were ignored is skipped\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n    However, different test ideas can be combined into a single test; for example, the following test satisfies test ideas\n    2, 6, and 7:\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Setup:</strong> Collection initialized to [\"dawn\", \"Dawn\"]<br />\n    <strong>Invocation:</strong> Collection.find(\"Dawn\", false)<br />\n    <strong>Expected result:</strong> Return value is 1 (it would be 0 if \"dawn\" were not skipped)\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Test Idea Simplicity and Complexity\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Making test ideas nonspecific makes them easier to combine.<br />\n    Creating many several small tests that satisfy a few test ideas makes it simpler to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        \"Copy and Tweak\" the tests to meet other test idea\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Easy of debugging - if you have test that covers 2 test ideas then you know the fault is one or two area, but if\n        the test covers 7 test ideas you will spend more time debugging the issue.&nbsp;\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    If the test ideas list were complete, with a test idea for every fault in the program, it wouldn't matter how you wrote\n    the tests. But the list is always missing some test ideas that could find bugs. Smaller more complex tests increase the\n    chance the test will satisfy a test idea that you didn't know you needed.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Complex Tests\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Sometimes when you're creating more complex tests, new test ideas come to mind. However, there are reasons for not\n    creating complex tests.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Complex test are more difficult to debug because they usually cover multiple test ideas\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Complex tests are more difficult to understand and maintain. The intent of the test is less obvious.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Complex tests are more difficult to create.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Constructing a test that satisfies five test ideas often takes more time than constructing five tests that each\n    satisfies one. Moreover, it's easier to make mistakes - to think you're satisfying all five when you're only satisfying\n    four.<br />\n    In practice, find a reasonable balance between complexity and simplicity.<br />\n</p>"

                          "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The test suite provides a means of managing the complexity of the test implementation. Many system test efforts fail\n    because the team gets lost in the minutia of all of the detailed tests, and subsequently loses control of the test\n    effort. Similar to UML packages, test suites provide a hierarchy of encapsulating containers to help manage the test\n    implementation. They provide a means of managing the strategic aspects of the test effort by collecting tests together\n    in related groups that can be planned, managed, and assessed in a meaningful way.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The test suite represents a container for organizing arbitrary collections of related test scripts. This may be\n    realized (implemented) as one or more automated regression test suites, but the test suite can also be a work plan for\n    the implementation of a group of related manual test scripts. Note also that test suites can be nested hierarchically,\n    therefore one test suite may be enclosed within another.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Sometimes these groups of tests will relate directly to a subsystem or other system design element, but other times\n    they'll relate directly to things such as quality dimensions, core \"mission critical\" functions, requirements\n    compliance, standards adherence, and many others concerns that are organized based on requirements and therefore cut\n    across the internal system elements.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Consider creating test suites that arrange the available test scripts, in addition to other test suites, in many\n    different combinations: the more variations you have, the more you'll increase coverage and the potential for finding\n    errors. Give thought to a variety of test suites that will cover the breadth and depth of the target test items.\n    Remember the corresponding implication that a single test script (or test suite) may appear in many different test\n    suites.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Some test automation tools provide the ability to automatically generate or assemble test suites. There are also\n    implementation techniques that enable automated test suites to dynamically select all or part of their component test\n    scripts for each test cycle run.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Test suites can help you maintain your test assets and impose a level of organization that facilitates the entire\n    testing effort.&nbsp; Like physical objects, tests can break. It's not that they wear down, it's that something changed\n    in their environment. Perhaps they've been ported to a new operating system. Or, more likely, the code they exercise\n    has changed in a way that correctly causes the test to fail. Suppose you're working on version 2.0 of an e-banking\n    application. In version 1.0, this method was used to log in:\n</p>\n<p class=\"codeSample\">\n    public boolean login (String username);\n</p>\n<p>\n    In version 2.0, the marketing department has realized that password protection might be a good idea. So the method is\n    changed to this:\n</p>\n<p class=\"codeSample\">\n    public boolean login (String username, String password);\n</p>\n<p>\n    Any test that uses the first form of the login will fail. It won't even compile. In this example you could find that,\n    not many useful tests can be written that don't use login. You might be faced with hundreds or thousands of failing\n    tests.\n</p>\n<p>\n    These tests can be fixed by using a global search-and-replace tool that finds every instance of login(something) and\n    replaces it with login(something, \"dummy password\"). Then arrange for all the testing accounts to use that password,\n    and you're on your way.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Then, when marketing decides that passwords should not be allowed to contain spaces, you get to do it all over again.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This kind of thing is a wasteful burden, especially when, as is often the case, the test changes aren't so easily made.\n    There is a better way.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Suppose that the test scripts originally did not call the product's login method. Rather, they called a library method\n    that does whatever it takes to get the test logged in and ready to proceed. Initially, that method might look like\n    this:\n</p>\n<p class=\"codeSample\">\n    public boolean testLogin (String username) {<br />\n    &nbsp; return product.login(username);<br />\n    }\n</p>\n<p>\n    When the version 2.0 change happens, the utility library is changed to match:\n</p>\n<p class=\"codeSample\">\n    public Boolean testLogin (String username) {<br />\n    &nbsp; return product.login(username, \"dummy password\");<br />\n    }\n</p>\n<p>\n    Instead of a changing a thousand tests, you change one method.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Ideally, all the needed library methods would be available at the beginning of the testing effort. In practice, they\n    can't all be anticipated-you might not realize you need a testLogin utility method until the first time the product\n    login changes. So test utility methods are often \"factored out\" of existing tests as needed. It is very important that\n    you perform this ongoing test repair, even under schedule pressure. If you do not, you will waste much time dealing\n    with an ugly and un-maintainable test suite. You might well find yourself throwing it away, or being unable to write\n    the needed numbers of new tests because all your available testing time is spent maintaining old ones.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Note: the tests of the product's login method will still call it directly. If its behavior changes, some or all of\n    those tests will need to be updated. (If none of the login tests fail when its behavior changes, they're probably not\n    very good at detecting defects.)\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Abstraction helps manage complexity\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The previous example showed how tests can abstract away from the concrete application. Most likely you can do\n    considerably more abstraction. You might find that a number of tests begin with a common sequence of method calls: they\n    log in, set up some state, and navigate to the part of the application you're testing. Only then does each test do\n    something different. All this setup could-and should-be contained in a single method with an evocative name such as\n    readyAccountForWireTransfer. By doing that, you're saving considerable time when new tests of a particular type are\n    written, and you're also making the intent of each test much more understandable.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Understandable tests are important. A common problem with old test suites is that no one knows what the tests are doing\n    or why. When they break, the tendency is to fix them in the simplest possible way. That often results in tests that are\n    weaker at finding defects. They no longer test what they were originally intended to test.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Throwing away tests\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Even with utility libraries, a test might periodically be broken by behavior changes that have nothing to do with what\n    it checks. Fixing the test doesn't stand much of a chance of finding a defect due to the change; it's something you do\n    to preserve the chance of the test finding some other defect someday. But the cost of such a series of fixes might\n    exceed the value of the tests hypothetically finding a defect. It might be better to simply throw the test away and\n    devote the effort to creating new tests with greater value.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Most people resist the notion of throwing away a test, at least until they're so overwhelmed by the maintenance burden\n    that they throw all the tests away. It is better to make the decision carefully and continuously, test by test, asking:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        How much work will it be to fix this test well, perhaps adding to the utility library?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        How else might the time be used?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        How likely is it that the test will find serious defects in the future? What's been the track record of it and\n        related tests?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        How long will it be before the test breaks again?\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The answers to these questions will be rough estimates or even guesses. But asking them will yield better results than\n    simply having a policy of fixing all tests.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Another reason to throw away tests is that they are now redundant. For example, early in development, there might be a\n    multitude of simple tests of basic parse-tree construction methods (the LessOp constructor and the like). Later, during\n    the writing of the parser, there will be a number of parser tests. Since the parser uses the construction methods, the\n    parser tests will also indirectly test them. As code changes break the construction tests, it's reasonable to discard\n    some of them as being redundant. Of course, any new or changed construction behavior will need new tests. They might be\n    implemented directly (if they're hard to test thoroughly through the parser) or indirectly (if tests through the parser\n    are adequate and more maintainable).\n</p>"

By keeping the review team small, it is easier to make rapid progress. However, informal reviews can miss\n    important perspectives&nbsp;of&nbsp;critical stakeholders.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Formal reviews\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Requirement reviews can be formal meetings. Start with careful preparation, so that you receive and organize comments\n    before the meeting. The meeting itself should produce decisions on all review items. After the meeting, you must pursue\n    the review actions to completion. If these actions involve a substantial amount of work or require a change to an\n    artifact that is under configuration control, consider submitting change requests to prioritize and track the work.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Formal reviews are more wide-ranging and expensive.

                          "<h3>\n    Sources of Requirements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Good requirements start with good sources. Finding those quality sources is an important task and, fortunately, one\n    that&nbsp;takes few&nbsp;resources. Examples of sources of requirements include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Customers\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Users\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Administrators and maintenance&nbsp;staff\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Partners\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Domain Experts\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Industry Analysts\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Information about competitors&nbsp;\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Requirements Gathering Techniques\n</h3>\n<p>\n    After you have identified these sources, there are a number of techniques that may be used to gather requirements. The\n    following will describe the various techniques, followed by a brief discussion of when to use each technique.\n</p>\n<p>\n    To get the requirements down on paper, you&nbsp;can to do one or more of the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Conduct a brainstorming session\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Interview users\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Send questionnaires\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Work in the target environment\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Study analogous systems\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Examine suggestions and problem reports\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Talk to support teams\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Study improvements made by users\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Look at unintended uses\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Conduct workshops\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Demonstrate prototypes to stakeholders\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The best idea is to get the requirements down quickly and then to encourage the users to correct and improve them. Put\n    in those corrections, and repeat the cycle. Do it now, keep it small, and correct it at once. Start off with the best\n    structure you can devise, but expect to keep on correcting it throughout the process.&nbsp; Success tips: Do it now,\n    keep it small, and correct it immediately.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Conduct a brainstorming session\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Brainstorming is a short group session where everyone is allowed to say whatever they feel is important to the topic of\n    discussion. After that, a facilitator leads the group in organizing and prioritizing the results.&nbsp; The following\n    basic rules for brainstorming&nbsp;ensures better results:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Start out by clearly stating the objective of the brainstorming session.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Generate as may ideas as possible.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Let your imagination soar.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Do not allow criticism or debate while you are gathering information.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Once information is gathered,&nbsp;reshape and combine ideas.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Interview users\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Face-to-face contact with users through individual interviewing is the primary source of requirements and an important\n    way you gather and validate their requirements. Remember that it is not the only possible technique, and that you can\n    conduct interviews many different ways. Develop a repertoire of styles to&nbsp;fit different situations. Unless you use\n    the system yourself, you will need to make an effort to understand and experience the user's problem to describe it\n    clearly and correctly.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Send Questionnaires\n</h4>\n<p>\n    If face-to-face meetings are possible, they are always preferable, because they provide a better means of uncovering\n    the problem behind the problem. Sometimes, though,&nbsp;face-to-face meetings with stakeholders are not feasible (when\n    developing products for the consumer market, for example). In those situations, consider using questionnaires.&nbsp;\n    Send a set of questions, possibly with multiple choice responses, to the relevant stakeholders, and ask them to\n    complete it and return it to you.&nbsp; Success&nbsp;tips: Keep it short and given them a deadline.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    This technique has the advantage of providing a lot of information for statistical analysis. However, the questions\n    must be well designed to be clear and to avoid so-called \"leading questions\", which bias the responses.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Work in the target environment\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Experience the work of the users for yourself. Working with users helps you understand problems that have resisted\n    previous solutions. Familiar systems developed in this way inevitably include tools for programmers, such as\n    interactive editors and compilers, as the developers naturally have both the expertise in the subject area, and the\n    desire to solve their own problems. It would be good to see the same dedication devoted to solving problems in other\n    areas too. Where the work cannot easily be experienced in this way, it may still be possible to do a bit more than just\n    sit quietly and observe. Users can give you a commentary on what they are doing, what the problems are, and what they\n    would like to have to make the work easier.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Study analogous systems\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The starting point for many projects is often a similar or an existing system. Sometimes, comparable products and\n    systems contain working versions of good ideas for solving user problems. You can save the time lost in reinventing the\n    wheel by looking at systems already on the market, whether they are systems installed at the user's site or products\n    made by rival organizations. Even if they are trying to solve slightly different problems, they often&nbsp;provide\n    valuable clues as to what you need to do.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Listen when a customer asks why a product couldn't do something that the customer wants, and keep a list of these\n    suggestions. Later, use it to start discussions with other users. You should be able to obtain some requirements\n    directly this way. If not, capture and store suggestions for future use.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You can describe to users selected features of other products. Explain that the system is designed for&nbsp;another\n    purpose&nbsp;but contains an interesting feature, and you wonder it or something similar&nbsp;would help them.\n    Sometimes these systems are described in documents, such as a contract from another organization or a report written\n    for management. Often, these documents were never intended as formal requirements, and were written merely to\n    communicate a stream-of-consciousness idea. Define a process of going from disorganized to organized information.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Such a process might involve the following activities:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Read the document from end to end (several times) to comprehend what the customer wants and what actually has been\n        written.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Classify all of the types of information in the document. (user, system requirements, design elements, plans,\n        background material, irrelevant detail)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Mark up the original text to separate out such requirements.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Find a good structure for each of the different types of information such as: a scenario for the user requirements,\n        functional breakdown for the system requirements, and architecture for the design.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Organize the information to show gaps and overlaps. Feel free to add missing elements, but confirm these decisions\n        with the users.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Create traceability links between these information elements to show the designers exactly what the users want.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Convince the customer to accept the new information as the basis for the contract.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Examine suggestions and problem reports\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Requirements can come from change suggestions and user problems. A direct road to finding requirements is to look at\n    suggestions and problems as first described. Most organizations have a form for reporting system problems or software\n    defects. You can ask to look through the reports (and there will probably be many). Sort them into groups so you can\n    identify the key areas that are troubling users. Ask users some questions about these areas to clarify the users'\n    actual needs.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Talk to support teams\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Most large sales organizations have a help desk that keeps a log of problems and fixes, and support engineers who do\n    the fixing. Many organizations have similar facilities to support their own operations. Talking to the help desk staff\n    and the support engineers may give you good leads into the requirements, and save you time. Also talk to the training\n    team and installation teams about what users find to be&nbsp;difficult.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Study improvements made by users\n</h4>\n<p>\n    This is an excellent source of requirements. Users of a standard company spreadsheet may have added a few fields, or\n    related different sheets together, or drawn a graph, that exactly meets their individual needs. You need only ask: Why\n    did you add that? Their answers help you&nbsp;get to the heart of the actual requirement. This applies also to hardware\n    and non-computer devices. For example, a lathe operator may have manufactured a special clamp, or an arm that prevents\n    movement of the tool beyond a certain point. Any such modification points to something wrong with the existing product,\n    which makes it&nbsp;a valid&nbsp;requirement for the new version.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Look at unintended uses\n</h4>\n<p>\n    People often use things for purposes for which they were not designed.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;a good way to get new ideas\n    and to think of innovations. For example, an observant product manager noticed that an engineer was staying in the\n    office late to use an advanced computer-aided design system to design a new kitchen layout for his home. Inexpensive\n    commercial products are now widely available for home use.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Conduct workshops\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Workshops can rapidly pull together a good set of requirements. In two to five days, you can create a set of\n    requirements, and then review and improve them. If everyone in a workshop tries to estimate the cost and value of each\n    requirement, the document becomes much more useful and cost-effective.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Workshops are quicker and better at discovering requirements than other techniques, such as sending questionnaires. You\n    are bringing the right collection of people together, and getting them to correct and improve on their requirements\n    document.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A workshop is inherently expensive because of the number of people involved, but it saves a large amount of time. If\n    you can define the product right the first time and cut three months off the requirements gathering, the savings could\n    be enormous. The workshop has to be thoroughly organized to take advantage of people's time.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Choose a quiet location for the workshop so that people are not disturbed by day-to-day business. Mobile phones should\n    be discouraged; arrange to take messages externally. Take advantage of informal interactions by choosing a site so that\n    people don't go home at night or go out separately. The example&nbsp;in Figure 1&nbsp;shows the logic of a requirements\n    workshop. Note that the workshop provides the environment in which to apply other requirements-gathering techniques\n    such as brainstorming.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img height=\"381\" alt=\"\" src=\"core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/resources/workshop_activity_diagram.gif\" width=\"542\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Figure 1: Conducting Workshops</strong>\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Demonstrate prototypes to stakeholders\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Prototypes allow us to immediately see some aspects of the system. Showing users a simple prototype can\n    provoke&nbsp;them into giving good requirements information or changing their mind about existing requirements. The\n    techniques described here help you gather ideas for requirements. Prototypes and models are an excellent way of\n    presenting ideas to users. They can illustrate how an approach might work, or give users a glimpse of what they might\n    be able to do. More requirements are likely to emerge when users see what you are suggesting.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A presentation can use a sequence of slides, storyboard, an artist's impression, or even an animation to give users a\n    vision of the possibilities. When prototyping software, make a mock-up of the user interface screens, emphasizing that\n    there is no code and that the system has not been designed or even specified yet (fair warning: there are dangers here\n    for the unwary).\n</p>\n<p>\n    This prototyping aims to get users to express (missing) requirements. You are not trying to sell users an idea or\n    product, you are finding out what they actually want. Seeing a prototype, which invariably is wrong in some ways and\n    right in others, is a powerful stimulus to users to start saying what they want. They may point out plenty of problems\n    with the prototype! This is excellent,&nbsp;because each problem leads to a new requirement.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Which Technique to Apply?\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Which technique to apply depends on a number of factors, such as:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Availability and location of stakeholders\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Development team knowledge of the problem domain\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Customers' and users' knowledge of the problem domain\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Customers' and users' knowledge of the development process and methods\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    If the stakeholders are not co-located or readily available, for example in the case of a product being developed for\n    mass market,&nbsp;techniques such as brainstorming, interviews and workshops that require face-to-face contact with the\n    stakeholders may be difficult or impossible.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If the stakeholders are available for face-to-face meetings, this is a much better situation and almost all of the\n    techniques described, or combination of them, may be applied. In this case, the domain and development experience of\n    both the stakeholders and the development team are critical factors in selecting the appropriate technique.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Figure 2, adapted from <a\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">[HIC03]</a>, provides a framework for determining the appropriate techniques.

Try to write as\n    clearly and explicitly as possible. Be specific. Remember, though, that if you carry this too far, the text becomes\n    dull and unreadable, which makes it difficult for other people to review. Although this guideline emphasizes\n    structured, written expression of requirements, informal text, diagrams, conversations, and phone calls are excellent\n    ways of removing ambiguity.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Some constructions (such as the use of or and unless in requirements) allow different groups of readers to understand\n    different things from the same wording. Developers could use this technique deliberately, so as to postpone, until too\n    late, any possibility of the customer's asking for what was truly wanted. This is dangerous and could easily backfire.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The only approach that works is for developers to make requirements as clear as possible, and for all stakeholders to\n    co-operate. In the long run, project success is in everybody's interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Dangerous ambiguities can be caused by the word <strong>or</strong> and also by many more-subtle errors.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Example\n</h5>\n<p>\n    <em>The same subsystem shall also be able to generate a visible or audible caution/warning signal for the attention of\n    the co-pilot or navigator.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Which subsystem? Is the signal to be visible, audible, or both? Is it both caution and warning, just caution, or just\n    warning? Is it for both the co-pilot and the navigator, or just one of them? If just one of them, which one and under\n    what conditions?\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Don't make multiple requirements.\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Requirements which contain conjunctions (words that join independent clauses together) are dangerous. Problems arise\n    when readers try to figure out which part applies, especially if the different clauses seem to conflict, or if the\n    individual parts apply separately. Multiple requirements also make verification more complex.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Dangerous conjunctions include: and, or, but.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Example\n</h5>\n<p>\n    <em>The battery low warning lamp shall light up when the voltage drops below 3.6 Volts, and the current workspace or\n    input data shall be saved.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Should the battery low warning lamp light up when the voltage drops and the workspace is saved? Should the battery low\n    warning lamp light up and the workspace be saved when the voltage drops?\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Never use let-out or escape words\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Requirements that include options or exceptions are dangerous. They seem to ask for something definite, but at the last\n    moment they back down and allow for other options. Problems arise when the requirements are to be tested, and someone\n    has to decide what (if anything) could prove the requirement was met.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Dangerous words that imply exceptions include: if, when, but, except, unless, although.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Examples\n</h5>\n<p>\n    <em>The forward passenger doors shall open automatically when the aircraft has halted, except when the rear ramp is\n    deployed.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <em>The fire alarm shall always be sounded when smoke is detected, unless the alarm is being tested or the engineer has\n    suppressed the alarm.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The latter sentence is a truly dangerous requirement!\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Don't ramble.\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Long rambling sentences, especially when combined with arcane language, references to unreachable documents, and other\n    defects of writing, quickly lead to confusion and error.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Example\n</h5>\n<p>\n    <em>Provided that the designated input signals from the specified devices are received in the correct order where the\n    system is able to differentiate the designators, the output signal shall comply with the required framework of section\n    3.1.5 to indicate the desired input state.</em>\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Resist designing the system\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Requirements should specify the design envelope without unnecessary constraints on a specific design. If we supply too\n    much detail we start to design the system. Going too far is tempting for designers, especially when they come to their\n    favorite bits.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Danger signs include names of components, materials, software objects/procedures, and database fields.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Example\n</h5>\n<p>\n    <em>The antenna shall be capable of receiving FM signals, using a copper core with nylon covering and a waterproof\n    hardened rubber shield.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Specifying design rather than actual need increases the cost of systems by placing needless constraints on development\n    and manufacture. Often knowing why is much better than knowing what.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Avoid mixing different kinds of requirements\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The user requirements form a complete model of what users want. They need to be organized coherently to show gaps and\n    overlaps. The same applies to system requirements, which form a complete functional model of the proposed system. A\n    quick road to confusion is to mix up requirements for users, systems, and how the system should be designed, tested, or\n    installed.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Danger signs are any references to system, design, testing, or installation.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Example\n</h5>\n<p>\n    <em>The user shall be able to view the currently selected channel number which shall be displayed in 14pt Swiss type on\n    an LCD panel tested to Federal Regulation Standard 567-89 and mounted with shockproof rubber washers.</em>\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Do not speculate.\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Requirements are part of a contract between customer and developer. There is no room for wish lists, meaning general\n    terms about things that somebody probably wants.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Danger signs include vagueness about which type of user is speaking, and generalization such as: usually, generally,\n    often, normally, typically.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Example\n</h5>\n<p>\n    <em>Users normally require early indication of intrusion into the system.</em>\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Do not use vague, undefined terms\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Many words used informally to indicate system quality are too vague for use in requirements. Vague terms include, among\n    others: user-friendly, versatile, flexible, approximately, as possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Requirements using these terms are unverifiable because there is no definite test to show whether the system has the\n    indicated property.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Examples\n</h5>\n<p>\n    <em>The print dialog shall be versatile and user-friendly.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <em>The OK status indicator lamp shall be illuminated as soon as possible after the system self-check is\n    completed.</em>\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Do not express possibilities.\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Suggestions that are not explicitly stated as requirements are invariably ignored by developers.\n</p>\n<p>\n    \"Possible options\" are indicated with terms such as: may, might, should, ought, could, perhaps, probably\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Example\n</h5>\n<p>\n    <em>The reception subsystem probably ought to be powerful enough to receive a signal inside a steel-framed\n    building.</em>\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Avoid wishful thinking.\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Engineering is a real-world activity. No system or component is perfect. Wishful thinking means asking for the\n    impossible.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Wishful-thinking terms include: reliable, safe, handle all unexpected failures, please all users, run on all platforms,\n    never fail, upgradeable to all future situations.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Examples\n</h5>\n<p>\n    <em>The gearbox shall be 100% safe in normal operation.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <em>The network shall handle all unexpected errors without crashing.</em>\n</p>"

                          "<p>\n    To write a good requirement, you must write it as a complete sentence, with a subject and a predicate (usually a verb).\n    The subject&nbsp;is an Actor, a stakeholder, the system under development, or a design entity that is related to the\n    requirement. The predicate specifies a condition, action, or intended result that is done for, by, with, or to the\n    subject.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Consistent use of the verb <strong>to be</strong> solidifies the link between the subject and the predicate.

The need for this practice takes on added\n    importance in a highly collaborative environment. The team should have a standard way of naming and formatting things\n    so they can understand the code quickly and know where to look at all times. This enables shared code ownership since\n    any team member should be able to quickly understand the code written by others.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    Ideally, the coding standard should be the result of team consensus. Involving the team members will aid adoption of\n    the standards.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Coding Standards cover such areas as:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Naming standards. This includes the naming of elements all the way down to the smallest variable. In covering\n        larger-scale elements, this overlaps into what could be considered design standards.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        File organization. This includes file naming conventions and how the files will be organized on the file system.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Comment standards. Too much emphasis on comments implies a lack of confidence that readable code is being written,\n        plus there is always a concern that the comments are not up to date. Yet, a consistent approach to comments\n        improves understandability and can support the ability to generate documentation from the code.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Coding conventions. Consistent application of specific code-level conventions and the exclusion of some considered\n        poor form improve the quality of the code.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        White space.

                          "<h4>\n    <a id=\"Introduction\" name=\"Introduction\">Introduction</a>\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Design must define enough of the system so that it can be implemented unambiguously. What constitutes enough varies\n    from project to project and company to company.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In some cases the design resembles a sketch, elaborated only far enough to ensure that the implementer can proceed (a\n    \"sketch and code\" approach). The degree of specification varies with the expertise of the implementer, the complexity\n    of the design, and the risk that the design might be misconstrued.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In other cases, the design is elaborated to the point that the design can be transformed automatically into code. This\n    typically involves extensions to standard UML to represent language and/or environment specific semantics.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The design may also be hierarchical, such as the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        a high level design model which sketches an overview of the overall system\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        a subsystem specification model which precisely specifies the required interfaces and behavior of major subsystems\n        within the system\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        a detailed design model for the internals of subsystems\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The sections below describe some different options for relating a design and implementation, and discuss benefits and\n    drawbacks of these approaches.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    <a id=\"sketch\" name=\"sketch\">Sketch and Code</a>\n</h4>\n<p>\n    One common approach to design is to sketch out the design at a fairly abstract level, and then move directly to code.\n    Maintenance of the design model is manual.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In this approach, we let a design class be an abstraction of several code-level classes. We recommend that you map each\n    design class to one \"head\" class that, in turn, can use several \"helper\" classes to perform its behavior. You can use\n    \"helper\" classes to implement a complex attribute or to build a data structure that you need for the implementation of\n    an operation. In design, you don't model the \"helper\" classes and you only model the key attributes, relationships, and\n    operations defined by the head class. The purpose of such a model is to abstract away details that can be completed by\n    the implementer.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This approach is extended to apply to the other design model elements. You may have design interfaces which are more\n    abstract than the code-level interfaces, and so on.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    <a id=\"round\" name=\"round\">Round-Trip Engineering</a>\n</h4>\n<p>\n    In round-trip engineering environments, the design model evolves to a level of detail where it becomes a visual\n    representation of the code. The code and its visual representation are synchronized (with tool support).\n</p>\n<p>\n    The following are some options for representing a Design Model in a round-trip engineering context.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b><a id=\"trace\" name=\"trace\">High Level Design Model and Detailed Design Model</a></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In this approach, there are two levels of design model maintained. Each high level design element is an abstraction of\n    one or more detailed elements in the round-tripped model. For example, a design class may map to one \"head\" class and\n    several \"helper\" classes, just as in the \"sketch and code\" approach described previously. Traceability from the high\n    level design model elements to round-trip model elements can help maintain consistency between the two models.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Although this can help abstract away less important details, this benefit must be balanced against the effort required\n    to maintain consistency between the models.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b><a id=\"evolves\" name=\"evolves\">Single Evolving Design Model</a></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In this approach, there is a single Design Model. Initial sketches of design elements evolve to the point where they\n    can be synchronized with code. Diagrams, such as those used to describe design use-case realizations, initially\n    reference sketched design classes, but eventually reference language-specific classes. High level descriptions of the\n    design are maintained as needed, such as:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        diagrams of the logical structure of the system,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        subsystem/component specifications,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        design patterns / mechanisms.<br />\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Such a model is easier to maintain consistent with the implementation.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    <a id=\"specification\" name=\"specification\">Specification and Realization Models</a>\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A related approach is to define the design in terms of specifications for major subsystems, detailed to the point where\n    client implementations can compile against them.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The detailed design of the subsystem realization can be modeled and maintained separately from this specification\n    model.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Models can be detailed and used to generate an implementation. Both structure (class and package diagrams) and behavior\n    diagrams (such as collaboration, state, and activity diagrams) can be used to generate executable code. These initial\n    versions can be further refined as needed.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The design may be platform-independent to varying degrees. Platform-specific design models or even code can be\n    generated by transformations that apply various rules to map high-level abstractions of platform-specific elements.\n    This is the focus of the Object Management Group (OMG) Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) <a href=\"http://www.omg.org/\"\n    target=\"_blank\">(http://www.omg.org</a>) initiative.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Platform-specific visual models can be used to generate an initial code framework. This framework can be further\n    elaborated with additional code not specified in the design.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Patterns\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Standard patterns can be applied to generate design and code elements from related design and implementation. For\n    example, a standard transformation pattern can be applied to a data table to create Java&trade; classes to access the data\n    table. Another example is using an <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/emf/\" target=\"_blank\">Eclipse Modeling Framework</a>\n    to generate code for storing data that matches the model and to generate a user interface implementation for populating\n    data. A pattern or transformation engine can be used to create the implementation, or the implementation can be done by\n    hand. Pattern engines are easier and more reliable, but handwritten code implementing a defined pattern will have fewer\n    errors than handwritten code implementing a novel or unique design.\n</p><br />"

                          "<p>\n    Refactoring involves improving the quality of existing code without changing the system's behavior. It is explicitly\n    not about adding or changing behavior, but about improving the implementation quality of existing behavior.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A full set of developer tests is required before refactoring can be safely applied. It is critical that the system\n    behavior be in a known, verifiably correct state before modifying the implementation so that you can improve the\n    quality without fear that the modified implementation will break something. Refactoring is a safe transformation to\n    improve code, but it is safe only if there are tests that can verify that the system still works as intended.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Refactoring is initiated when an area that needs improvement is identified in the system by examining either the code\n    or&nbsp;some other&nbsp;representation of the design. The issues identified are sometimes called \"smells.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n    Here are several smells to look for that might lead to implementation or design refactoring:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Duplicated code:</b> Duplicated code makes the system harder to understand and harder to maintain.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Large design element or method:</b> Large design elements or methods diminish the ability of people to\n        understand the code, reduce the potential for reuse, and make developer testing more difficult.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Poorly named element:</b> Whether the element be a variable, function, class, or implementation element, its\n        name should connote what it is so that the code can be maintained.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Tight coupling:</strong> Each design element should work with minimal concern for the internal aspects of\n        other design elements. Otherwise, changes to one element can have undesirable effects in other elements.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    As you can see from this list, refactoring can improve the \"internals\" of an element or&nbsp;the interface of the\n    element. Also, many of the smells&nbsp;are characterized as making the software more difficult to understand; whereas\n    refactoring is about making the system simpler.\n</p>\n<p>\n    After an issue is identified, a refactoring method can be selected that will improve the situation. There are catalogs\n    of refactoring methods available that are change patterns that will fix common problems while retaining the behavior of\n    the system.\n</p>\n<p>\n    These are examples of refactoring methods:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Extract Method:</b> Pull out the duplicated code into its own single method or extract part of a large method\n        into its own method.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Extract Class:</b> Pull some cohesive part of a class into its own class to reduce the size of a design element\n        that is too big.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Rename Method</b>, <b>Rename Class</b>, or <b>Rename Variable:</b> Give a more meaningful name to an element to\n        make it more understandable.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Extract Interface:</b> Create a clean interface.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    After refactoring has been applied, developer tests are run again to ensure that the system still behaves correctly. It\n    is important that the system is working correctly after each small refactoring. Although many refactorings can be put\n    together to drive broad change across the code base, the tests should run correctly between each refactoring applied.\n    Refactoring must be applied as small behavior-preserving transformations.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As mentioned previously, refactoring requires full developer test coverage of the area under consideration. There are\n    additional techniques that enable refactoring. Coding standards define a common style and make it easier to refactor\n    consistently. An attitude of&nbsp;collective code ownership within the team is important. Each developer should feel\n    that refactoring can be applied across the code base to improve the implementation.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For deeper coverage on this topic, including a listing of \"smells\" and a catalog of refactorings to respond to them,\n    see [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#FOW99\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">FOW99</a>].\n</p>"

Successful tests find bugs, but correcting the bugs falls into other areas.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Test early and often. The cost of change rises exponentially the longer it takes to find and then remove a defect.\n        The implication is that you want to test as early as possible.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Testing builds confidence. Many people fear making a change to their code because they are afraid that they will\n        break it, but with a full test suite in place if you do break something you know you will detect it and then fix\n        it.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        One test is worth a thousand opinions. You can say that your application works, but until you show the test results\n        you might not be believed.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Test to the risk. The riskier something is, the more it needs to be reviewed and tested. For example, you should\n        invest significantly more&nbsp;effort testing a safety-critical algorithm for measuring radiation doses, and far\n        less effort testing the \"change font size\" function of the same application.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        You can validate all artifacts. You can test all your artifacts, not just your source code, although the focus of\n        this guidance is testing code.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\n    Qualities of a Good Developer Test\n</h3>These are the qualities of a good developer test:\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n    <li>\n        It runs fast. It has short setup, run time, and clean-up.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        It runs in isolation. You should be able to reorder your tests.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        It is understandable. Good tests have consistent and informative names and use data that makes them easy to read\n        and to understand.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        It uses real data. For example, use copies of production data when appropriate, but remember that you'll typically\n        have to create some specific \"artificial\" test data as well.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        It is minimally cohesive. The test represents one step toward your overall goal. The test should address one and\n        one only issue.\n    </li>\n</ul>"

                          "<h3>\n    Establish expectations\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Those who find developer testing rewarding do it. Those who view it as a chore find ways to avoid it. This is simply in\n    the nature of most developers in most industries, and treating it as a shameful lack of discipline hasn't historically\n    been successful. Therefore, as a developer you should expect testing to be rewarding and do what it takes to make it\n    rewarding.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Ideal developer testing follows a very tight edit-test loop. You make a small change to the product, such as adding a\n    new method to a class, then you immediately rerun your tests. If any test breaks, you know exactly what code is the\n    cause. This easy, steady pace of development is the greatest reward of developer testing. A long debugging session\n    should be exceptional.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Because it's not unusual for a change made in one class to break something in another, you should expect to rerun not\n    just the changed class's tests, but many tests. Ideally, you rerun the complete test suite for your implementation\n    element many times per hour. Every time you make a significant change, you rerun the suite, watch the results, and\n    either proceed to the next change or fix the last change. Expect to spend some effort making that rapid feedback\n    possible.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Write and maintain&nbsp;tests\n</h3>\n<h4>\n    Automate your tests\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Running tests often is not practical if tests are manual. For some implementation elements, automated tests are easy.\n    An example would be an in-memory database. It communicates to its clients through an API and has no other interface to\n    the outside world. Tests for it would look something like this:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n/* Check that elements can be added at most once. */\n// Setup\nDatabase db = new Database();\ndb.add(\"key1\", \"value1\");\n// Test\nboolean result = db.add(\"key1\", \"another value\");\nexpect(result == false);\n<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    The tests are different from ordinary client code in only one way: instead of believing the results of API calls, they\n    check. If the API makes client code easy to write, it makes test code easy to write. If the test code is <i>not</i>\n    easy to write, you've received an early warning that the API could be improved. Test-first design is thus consistent\n    with the iterative processes' focus on addressing important risks early.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The more tightly connected the element is to the outside world, however, the harder it will be to test. There are two\n    common cases: graphical user interfaces and back-end components.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Graphical user interfaces\n</h5>\n<p>\n    Suppose the database in the example above receives its data via a callback from a user-interface object. The callback\n    is invoked when the user fills in some text fields and pushes a button. Testing this by manually filling in the fields\n    and pushing the button isn't something you want to do many times an hour. You must arrange a way to deliver the input\n    under programmatic control, typically by \"pushing\" the button in code.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Pushing the button causes some code in the implementation element to be executed. Most likely, that code changes the\n    state of some user-interface objects. So you must also arrange a way to query those objects programmatically.\n</p>\n<h5>\n    Back-end components\n</h5>\n<p>\n    Suppose the element under test doesn't implement a database. Instead, it's a wrapper around a real, on-disk database.\n    Testing against that real database might be difficult. It might be hard to install and configure. Licenses for it might\n    be expensive. The database might slow down the tests enough that you're not inclined to run them often. In such cases,\n    it's worthwhile to \"stub out\" the database with a simpler element that does just enough to support the tests.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Stubs are also useful when a component that your element talks to isn't ready yet. You don't want your testing to wait\n    on someone else's code.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Don't write your own tools\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Developer testing seems pretty straightforward. You set up some objects, make a call through an API, check the result,\n    and announce a test failure if the results aren't as expected. It's also convenient to have some way to group tests so\n    that they can be run individually or as complete suites. Tools that support those requirements are called <i>test\n    frameworks</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Developer testing <b>is</b> straightforward, and the requirements for test frameworks are not complicated. If, however,\n    you yield to the temptation of writing your own test framework, you'll spend much more time tinkering with the\n    framework than you probably expect. There are many test frameworks available, both commercial and open source, and\n    there's no reason not to use one of those.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Do create support code\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Test code tends to be repetitive. It's common to see sequences of code like this:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n// null name not allowed\nretval = o.createName(\"\");\nexpect(retval == null);\n// leading spaces not allowed\nretval = o.createName(\" l\");\nexpect(retval == null);\n// trailing spaces not allowed\nretval = o.createName(\"name \");\nexpect(retval == null);\n// first character may not be numeric\nretval = o.createName(\"5allpha\");\nexpect(retval == null);\n<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    This code is created by copying one check, pasting it, then editing it to make another check.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The danger here is twofold. If the interface changes, much editing will have to be done. (In more complicated cases, a\n    simple global replacement won't suffice.) Also, if the code is at all complicated, the intent of the test can be lost\n    amid all the text.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When you find yourself repeating yourself, seriously consider factoring out the repetition into support code. Even\n    though the code above is a simple example, it's more readable and maintainable if written like this:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\nvoid expectNameRejected(MyClass o, String s) {\nObject retval = o.createName(s);\nexpect(retval == null);\n}\n...\n// null name not allowed\nexpectNameRejected(o, \"\");\n// leading spaces not allowed.\nexpectNameRejected(o, \" l\");\n// trailing spaces not allowed.\nexpectNameRejected(o, \"name \");\n// first character may not be numeric.\nexpectNameRejected(o, \"5alpha\");\n<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Developers writing tests often err on the side of too much copying-and-pasting. If you suspect yourself of that\n    tendency, it's useful to consciously err in the other direction. Resolve that you will strip your code of all duplicate\n    text.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Keep the tests understandable\n</h4>\n<p>\n    You should expect that you, or someone else, will have to modify the tests later. A typical situation is that a later\n    iteration calls for a change to the element's behavior. As a simple example, suppose the element once declared a square\n    root method like this:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        <font size=\"+0\">double sqrt(double x);</font>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    In that version, a negative argument caused the function \"sqrt\" to return NaN (\"not a number\" from the IEEE 754-1985\n    <i>Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic</i>). In the new iteration, the square root method will accept\n    negative numbers and return a complex result:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        <font size=\"+0\">Complex sqrt(double x);</font>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Old tests for the function \"sqrt\" will have to change. That means understanding what they do, and updating them so that\n    they work with the new \"sqrt\". When updating tests, you must take care not to destroy their bug-finding power. One way\n    that sometimes happens is this:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\nvoid testSQRT () {\n//  Update these tests for Complex\n// when I have time -- bem\n/*\ndouble result = sqrt(0.0);\n...\n*/\n}\n<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Other ways are more subtle: the tests are changed so that they actually run, but they no longer test what they were\n    originally intended to test. The end result, over many iterations, can be a test suite that is too weak to catch many\n    bugs. This is sometimes called \"test suite decay\". A decayed suite will be abandoned, because it's not worth the\n    upkeep.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Test suite decay is less likely in the direct tests for the function \"sqrt\" than in indirect tests. There will be code\n    that calls the function \"sqrt\". That code will have tests. When the function \"sqrt\" changes, some of those tests will\n    fail. The person who changes the function \"sqrt\" will probably have to change those tests. Because he's less familiar\n    with them, and because their relationship to the change is less clear, he's more likely to weaken them in the process\n    of making them pass.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When you're creating support code for tests (as urged above), be careful: the support code should clarify, not obscure,\n    the purpose of the tests that use it. A common complaint about object-oriented programs is that there's no one place\n    where anything's done. If you look at any one method, all you discover is that it forwards its work somewhere else.\n    Such a structure has advantages, but it makes it harder for new people to understand the code. Unless they make an\n    effort, their changes are likely to be incorrect or to make the code even more complicated and fragile. The same is\n    true of test code, except that later maintainers are even less likely to take due care. You must head off the problem\n    by writing understandable tests.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Match the test structure to the product structure\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Suppose someone has inherited your implementation element. They need to change a part of it. They may want to examine\n    the old tests to help them in their new design. They want to update the old tests before writing the code (test-first\n    design).\n</p>\n<p>\n    All those good intentions will go by the wayside if they can't find the appropriate tests. What they'll do is make the\n    change, see what tests fail, then fix those. That will contribute to test suite decay.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For that reason, it's important that the test suite be well structured, and that the location of tests be predictable\n    from the structure of the product. Most usually, developers arrange tests in a parallel hierarchy, with one test class\n    per product class. So if someone is changing a class named \"Log\", they know the test class is \"TestLog\", and they know\n    where the source file can be found.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Let tests violate encapsulation\n</h4>\n<p>\n    You might limit your tests to interacting with your implementation element exactly as client code does, through the\n    same interface that client code uses. However, this has disadvantages. Suppose you're testing a simple class that\n    maintains a doubly linked list:\n</p>\n<p>\n    In particular, you're testing the \"DoublyLinkedList.insertBefore(Object existing, Object newObject)\" method. In one of\n    your tests, you want to insert an element in the middle of the list, then check if it's been inserted successfully. The\n    test uses the list above to create this updated list:\n</p>\n<p>\n    It checks the list correctness like this:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n// the list is now one longer.\nexpect(list.size()==3);\n// the new element is in the correct position\nexpect(list.get(1)==m);\n// check that other elements are still there.\nexpect(list.get(0)==a);\nexpect(list.get(2)==z);\n<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    That seems sufficient, but it's not. Suppose the list implementation is incorrect and backward pointers are not set\n    correctly. That is, suppose the updated list actually looks like this:\n</p>\n<p>\n    If the function \"DoublyLinkedList.get(int index)\" traverses the list from the beginning to the end (likely), the test\n    would miss this failure. If the class provides \"elementBefore\" and \"elementAfter\" methods, checking for such failures\n    is straightforward:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n// Check that links were all updated\nexpect(list.elementAfter(a)==m);\nexpect(list.elementAfter(m)==z);\nexpect(list.elementBefore(z)==m); //this will fail\nexpect(list.elementBefore(m)==a);\n<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    But what if it doesn't provide those methods? You could devise more elaborate sequences of method calls that will fail\n    if the suspected defect is present. For example, this would work:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n// Check whether back-link from Z is correct.\nlist.insertBefore(z, x);\n// If it was incorrectly not updated, X will have\n// been inserted just after A.\nexpect(list.get(1)==m);\n<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    But such a test is more work to create and is likely to be significantly harder to maintain. (Unless you write good\n    comments, it will not be at all clear why the test is doing what it's doing.) There are two solutions:\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Add the \"elementBefore\" and \"elementAfter\" methods to the public interface. But that effectively exposes the\n        implementation to everyone and makes future change more difficult.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Let the tests \"look under the hood\" and check pointers directly.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n    The latter is usually the best solution, even for a simple class like \"DoublyLinkedList\" and especially for the more\n    complex classes that occur in your products.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Typically, tests are put in the same package as the class they test. They are given protected or friend access.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Approaches for Test Setup\n</h4>\n<p>\n    To successfully run a test, the system must be in a known state. To do this you will need objects or components in\n    memory, rows in the database, etc. that you will test against. The easiest approach is to hardcode the required data\n    and the setup code within the test itself. The primary advantage is that all the information that you need about the\n    test is in one place and that the test is potentially self-sufficient.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Another approach is to define an external data set which is loaded into memory or into the database at the beginning of\n    the test run. There are several advantages to this approach:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        It decouples the test data from the test.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        More than one test can use the same data set.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        It is easy to modify and/or multiply the test data.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    There are some disadvantages to this approach:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Increased complexity for maintaining the external data\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Potential coupling between test cases. When they share a common test data bed it becomes very easy to write tests\n        that depend on other tests running first, thereby coupling them together.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Coding for Testability\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Add&nbsp;<a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/termdefinitions/code_instrumentation_3060875F.html\"\n    guid=\"_lzAWkK9eEdyltJ0KgEd9WQ\">code instrumentation</a> for testing and debugging. Pay special attention to the\n    implementation of the observation/control points, such as critical functions or objects, as these aspects might need\n    special support that has to be implemented in the application under test.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Reviewing Tests\n</h4>\n<p>\n    If a test will be long-lived, ask a person with less inside knowledge of the implementation element to run it and check\n    if there is enough support information. Review it with other people within the development team and other interested\n    parties as needed.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <a id=\"TestDesignMistakes\" name=\"TestDesignMistakes\"></a>Characteristic Test Design Mistakes\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Each test exercises an implementation element and checks for correct results. The design of the test-the inputs it uses\n    and how it checks for correctness-can be good at revealing defects, or it can inadvertently hide them. Here are some\n    characteristic test design mistakes.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Failure to specify expected results in advance\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Suppose you're testing an implementation element that converts XML into HTML. A temptation is to take some sample XML,\n    run it through the conversion, then look at the results in a browser. If the screen looks right, you \"bless\" the HTML\n    by saving it as the official expected results. Thereafter, a test compares the actual output of the conversion to the\n    expected results.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This is a dangerous practice. Even sophisticated computer users are used to believing what the computer does. You are\n    likely to overlook mistakes in the screen appearance. (Not to mention that browsers are quite tolerant of misformatted\n    HTML.) By making that incorrect HTML the official expected results, you make sure that the test can never find the\n    problem.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It's less dangerous to doubly-check by looking directly at the HTML, but it's still dangerous. Because the output is\n    complicated, it will be easy to overlook errors. You'll find more defects if you write the expected output by hand\n    first.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Failure to check the background\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Tests usually check that what should have been changed has been, but their creators often forget to check that what\n    should have been left alone has been left alone. For example, suppose a program is supposed to change the first 100\n    records in a file. It's a good idea to check that the 101<sup>st</sup> hasn't been changed.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In theory, you would check that nothing in the \"background\"-the entire file system, all of memory, everything reachable\n    through the network-has been left alone. In practice, you have to choose carefully what you can afford to check. But\n    it's important to make that choice.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Failure to check persistence\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Just because the implementation element tells you a change has been made, that doesn't mean it has actually been\n    committed to the database. You need to check the database via another route.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Failure to add variety\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A test might be designed to check the effect of three fields in a database record, but many other fields need to be\n    filled in to execute the test. Testers will often use the same values over and over again for these \"irrelevant\"\n    fields. For example, they'll always use the name of their lover in a text field, or 999 in a numeric field.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The problem is that sometimes what shouldn't matter actually does. Every so often, there's a bug that depends on some\n    obscure combination of unlikely inputs. If you always use the same inputs, you stand no chance of finding such bugs. If\n    you persistently vary inputs, you might. Quite often, it costs almost nothing to use a number different than 999 or to\n    use someone else's name. When varying the values used in tests costs almost nothing and it has some potential benefit,\n    then vary. (Note: It's unwise to use names of old lovers instead of your current one if your current lover works with\n    you.)\n</p>\n<p>\n    Here's another benefit. One plausible fault is for the program to use field <i>X</i> when it should have used field\n    <i>Y</i>. If both fields contain \"Dawn\", the fault can't be detected.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Failure to use realistic data\n</h4>\n<p>\n    It's common to use made-up data in tests. That data is often unrealistically simple. For example, customer names might\n    be \"Mickey\", \"Snoopy\", and \"Donald\". Because that data is different from what real users enter - for example, it's\n    characteristically shorter - it can miss defects real customers will see. For example, these one-word names wouldn't\n    detect that the code doesn't handle names with spaces.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It's prudent to make a slight extra effort to use realistic data.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Failure to notice that the code does nothing at all\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Suppose you initialize a database record to zero, run a calculation that should result in zero being stored in the\n    record, then check that the record is zero. What has your test demonstrated? The calculation might not have taken place\n    at all. Nothing might have been stored, and the test couldn't tell.\n</p>\n<p>\n    That example sounds unlikely. But this same mistake can crop up in subtler ways. For example, you might write a test\n    for a complicated installer program. The test is intended to check that all temporary files are removed after a\n    successful installation. But, because of all the installer options, in that test, one particular temporary file wasn't\n    created. Sure enough, that's the one the program forgot to remove.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Failure to notice that the code does the wrong thing\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Sometimes a program does the right thing for the wrong reasons. As a trivial example, consider this code:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\nif (a &lt; b &amp;&amp; c)\nreturn 2 * x;\nelse\nreturn x * x;\n<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    The logical expression is wrong, and you've written a test that causes it to evaluate incorrectly and take the wrong\n    branch. Unfortunately, purely by coincidence, the variable X has the value 2 in that test. So the result of the wrong\n    branch is accidentally correct - the same as the result the right branch would have given.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For each expected result, you should ask if there's a plausible way in which that result could be&nbsp;achieved for the\n    wrong reason. While it's often impossible to know, sometimes it's not.\n</p>"

As the\n    project continues and you gain more knowledge, you will need to refine the mapping.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Proceed iteratively to refine the mapping between design and implementation mechanisms. Eliminate redundant paths,\n    working both top-down and bottom-up.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Working top-down:</b> When working top-down (from top to bottom), new and refined use-case realizations will put new\n    requirements on the necessary design mechanisms through the analysis mechanisms that you need. These new requirements\n    might uncover additional characteristics of a design mechanism, forcing a split between mechanisms. A compromise\n    between the system's complexity and its performance is also necessary:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Too many different design mechanisms make the system too complex.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Too few design mechanisms can create performance problems for implementation mechanisms that stretch the limits of\n        the reasonable ranges of the values of their characteristics.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    <b>Working bottom-up:</b> When working bottom-up (from bottom to top) and investigating the available implementation\n    mechanisms, you might find products that satisfy several design mechanisms at once, but force some adaptation or\n    repartitioning of your design mechanisms. You want to minimize the number of implementation mechanisms you use, but too\n    few of them can also lead to performance problems.\n</p>\n<p>\n    After you decide to use a DBMS to store class A objects, you might be tempted to use it to store all objects in the\n    system. This could be very inefficient or very cumbersome. Not all objects that require persistency need to be stored\n    in the DBMS. Some objects may be persistent, but one application may access them frequently, while other applications\n    access them only infrequently. A hybrid strategy, in which the object is read from the DBMS into memory and\n    periodically synchronized, may be the best approach.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    <p class=\"example\">\n        <b>Example</b>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"example\">\n        A flight can be stored both in memory for fast access and in a DBMS for long-term persistency. However, this\n        triggers a need for a mechanism to synchronize both.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    It is not uncommon to have more than one design mechanism associated with a client class as a compromise between\n    different characteristics.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Because implementation mechanisms often come in bundles in off-the-shelf components (operating systems and middleware\n    products), some optimization based on cost, impedance mismatch, or uniformity of style needs to occur. Also, mechanisms\n    are often interdependent, which makes clear separation of services into design mechanisms difficult.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    <p class=\"example\">\n        <b>Examples</b>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>\n            The notification mechanism can be based on the inter-process communication mechanism.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            The error reporting mechanism can be based on the persistency mechanism.\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Refinement continues over the whole Elaboration phase, and is always a compromise between:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        An exact fit with the requirements of the clients of the design mechanism, in terms of the expected\n        characteristics.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The cost and complexity of having too many different implementation mechanisms to acquire and integrate.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The overall goal is always to have a simple, clean set of mechanisms that give conceptual integrity, simplicity, and\n    elegance to a large system.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Describing Design Mechanisms\n</h3>\n<p>\n    As with analysis mechanisms, design mechanisms can be modeled using a collaboration, which may instantiate one or more\n    architectural or design patterns.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        <strong>Example: A persistence mechanism</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        This example uses an instance of a pattern for RDBMS-based persistency drawn from <a\n        href=\"http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Java&trade; Database Connectivity (JDBC)</u></a>.\n        Although we present the design here, JDBC supplies actual code for some of the classes. Therefore, it is a short\n        step from what is presented here to an implementation mechanism.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Figure 4, titled <strong>JDBC: Static view,</strong> shows the classes (actually, the classifier roles) in the\n    collaboration.\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img title=\"Figure 4.

A <strong>provided interface</strong> is one that is either implemented directly by the component\n    or one of its realizing classes or subcomponents, or it is the type of a provided port of the component. A\n    <strong>required interface</strong> is designated by a usage dependency of the component or one of its realizing\n    classes or subcomponents, or it is the type of a required port.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n    A component has an external view (or <em>black box</em> view) through its publicly visible properties and operations\n    .Optionally, a behavior such as a protocol state machine may be attached to an interface, a port, and the component\n    itself to define the external view more precisely by making dynamic constraints in the sequence of operation calls\n    explicit. The wiring between components in a system or other context can be structurally defined by using dependencies\n    between component interfaces (typically on component diagrams).\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n    Optionally, you can make a more detailed specification of the structural collaboration by using parts and connectors in\n    composite structures to specify the role or instance-level collaboration between components. That is the component's\n    internal view (or <em>white-box</em> view) through its private properties and realizing classes or subcomponents. This\n    view shows how the external behavior is realized internally. The mapping between external and internal views is by\n    dependencies on components diagrams or delegation connectors to internal parts on composite structure diagrams.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n    A number of UML standard stereotypes exist that apply to components, including &lt;&lt;subsystem&gt;&gt; to model\n    large-scale components, and &lt;&lt;specification&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;realization&gt;&gt; to model components with\n    distinct specification and realization definitions, where one specification may have multiple realizations.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n    The recommendation is to&nbsp;use components as the representation for design subsystems.\n</p>\n<h3 align=\"left\">\n    UML Definitions -- A History\n</h3>\n<p align=\"left\">\n    The definition of <em>component</em> with the UML has changed over time with the release of different versions.

In particular, it is difficult to draw a sharp line\n    between design and architecture-architecture is one aspect of design that concentrates on some specific features.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In An Introduction to Software Architecture, David Garlan and Mary Shaw suggest that software architecture is a level\n    of design concerned with issues: \"Beyond the algorithms and data structures of the computation; designing and\n    specifying the overall system structure emerges as a new kind of problem. Structural issues include gross organization\n    and global control structure; protocols for communication, synchronization, and data access; assignment of\n    functionality to design elements; physical distribution; composition of design elements; scaling and performance; and\n    selection among design alternatives.\" <a class=\"elementlinkwithusertext\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">[GAR93]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    But there is more to architecture than just structure; the IEEE Working Group on Architecture defines it as \"the\n    highest-level concept of a system in its environment\" <a class=\"elementlinkwithusertext\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">[IEP1471]</a>. It also encompasses the \"fit\" with system integrity, with economical\n    constraints, with aesthetic concerns, and with style. It is not limited to an inward focus, but takes into\n    consideration the system as a whole in its user environment and its development environment - an outward focus.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The architecture focuses on specific aspects of the overall system design, concentrating on structure, essential\n    elements, key scenarios and those aspects that have a lasting impact on system qualities such as performance,\n    reliability, adaptability and cost. It also defines the set of <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/arch_mechanism_2932DFB6.html\"\n    guid=\"_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA\">Architectural Mechanism</a>s, <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html\"\n    guid=\"_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Pattern</a>s and styles that will guide the rest of the design, assuring its integrity.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Purpose of Architecture\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The architecture can be used for many things:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>To describe the essential structure of the system and the decisions guiding the structure of the\n        system</strong> so the integrity and understandability of the system is assured.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <a id=\"Comment71_\" name=\"Comment71_\"><strong>To identify and attack risks to the system</strong> (using the\n        architecture as an artifact of governance)</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>To provide context and guidance for developers</strong> to construct the system by describing the\n        motivations behind the architectural decisions so those decisions can be robustly implemented. The architecture\n        services as the blueprint for development.&nbsp;For example, the architect may place constraints on how data is\n        packaged and communicated between different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the\n        justification in the Architecture Notebook can explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when\n        communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific\n        data packaging scheme.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>To provide an overview of the system to whoever must maintain the architecture</strong>, as well as an\n        understanding of the motivation behind the important technical decisions.&nbsp;

It may be a precise set of models or documents that describe the various aspects of the system's key elements.\n    Expressing it as skeletal implementation is another option - although this may need to be baselined and preserved to\n    ensure that the essence of the system can be understood as the system grows.

We use <em>component</em> to mean <strong>an encapsulated part of a\n    system</strong> that is nontrivial, nearly independent, and replaceable part of a system that fulfills a clear function\n    in the context of well-defined architecture.

However, if a set of files fully\n                implements a single component (and no other component), then the component source files are replaceable.\n                This characteristic makes it easier to use version control, to use the file as a baseline, and to reuse the\n                source file.\n            </p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <p>\n                <strong>Deployment replaceability:</strong> If two classes are deployed in a single executable file, then\n                each class is not independently replaceable in a deployed system.

They allow the\n    team to maintain a cohesive architecture while enabling implementation details to be deferred until they really need to\n    be made.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Architectural Mechanisms are&nbsp;used to satisfy architecturally significant requirements. Usually those are\n    non-functional requirements such as performance and security issues.&nbsp;When fully described, Architectural\n    Mechanisms show patterns of structure and behavior in the software. They&nbsp;form the basis of&nbsp;common\n    software&nbsp;that will be&nbsp;consistently applied&nbsp;across the product being developed. They also form the basis\n    for standardizing the way that the software works; therefore, they are an important element of the overall software\n    architecture. The definition of architecture mechanisms also enable decisions on whether existing software components\n    can be leveraged to provide the required behavior; or whether new software should be bought or built.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The value in defining architecture mechanisms is that they:\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Explicitly call out&nbsp;aspects of the solution mechanics that are common across the system. This helps you plan.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Put down markers for the developers to build those aspects of the system once and then re-use them. This reduces\n        the workload.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Promote the development of a consistent set of services. This makes the system easier to maintain.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n    An&nbsp;Architectural Mechanism can have three states: Analysis, Design and Implementation.&nbsp;These\n    categories&nbsp;reflect the maturity of the mechanism's description.

The transition from one state to another&nbsp;can often be obvious or intuitive. Therefore, it can be\n    achieved in a matter of seconds. It can also require more considered analysis and design, thus take longer.&nbsp;The\n    important point here is that these categories of mechanisms apply to the same concept in different states. The only\n    difference between them is one of refinement or detail.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The following diagram illustrates the transition of Architectural Mechanisms from one state to another.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>State Machine for Architectural Mechanisms</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img style=\"WIDTH: 876px; HEIGHT: 115px\" alt=\"Architectural Mechanism States\" src=\"core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/resources/arch_mech_states.jpg\"\n    width=\"600\" height=\"113\" />&nbsp;\n</p>\n<h3>\n    What Information Should be Captured for Architectural Mechanisms?\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The information captured for each architectural mechanism category/state is different (though the information can be\n    seen as refinements of each other):\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Analysis Mechanisms</strong>, which give the mechanism a name, brief description and some basic\n        attributes&nbsp;derived from&nbsp;the project requirements\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Design Mechanisms</strong>, which are more concrete and assume some details of the implementation\n        environment\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Implementation Mechanisms</strong>, which specify the&nbsp;exact implementation of&nbsp;each mechanism\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    When&nbsp;a mechanism is&nbsp;initially identified, it can be considered a marker that says to the team, \"We are going\n    to handle this aspect of the system in a standard way. We'll figure out the details later.\" As the project proceeds,\n    the architectural mechanisms are gradually refined until they become part of the software.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Analysis Mechanisms\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Analysis mechanisms&nbsp;are the initial state for an architectural mechanism. They are identified early in the project\n    and represent&nbsp;bookmarks for future software development. They allow the&nbsp;team to focus on understanding the\n    requirements without getting distracted by the specifics of a complex implementation. Analysis mechanisms are\n    discovered by surveying the requirements and looking for recurrent technical concepts.&nbsp;Security, persistence and\n    legacy interface are some examples of these. In effect, the analysis mechanism is where the requirements that\n    describe&nbsp;architecturally significant topics&nbsp;are collated and brought&nbsp;together in a single list. This\n    makes them easier to manage.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Analysis mechanisms are described in simple terms:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Name:</strong> Identifies the mechanism.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Basic attributes:</strong> Define the requirements of the mechanism. These attributes can vary depending\n        upon the mechanism being analyzed. Refer to <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n        href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/examples/architectural_mechanism_attributes_B0ECA2F7.html\"\n        guid=\"_eQ_s8Om5Edupia_tZIXEqg\">Example: Architectural Mechanism Attributes</a>&nbsp;for more guidance.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Once the list of analysis mechanisms has been defined it can be prioritized and the mechanisms refined in line\n    with&nbsp;iteration&nbsp;objectives. It is not necessary to develop the entire set of architecture mechanisms into\n    working software in a single pass. It is often more sensible to develop only those mechanisms required to support the\n    functionality to be delivered in the current iteration.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Design Mechanisms\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Design mechanisms&nbsp;represent decisions about the concrete technologies that are going to be used to&nbsp;develop\n    architectural mechanisms. For example, the decision to use an RDBMS for persistence. It's often no more complicated\n    than that (though of course, the effort involved in making the decision can sometimes be quite complex).\n</p>\n<p>\n    The decision on when to refine an architectural mechanism from an analysis state to a design state is largely\n    arbitrary. Often there will be constraints on the project that&nbsp;force the decision on some of these issues. For\n    example, there may be a corporate standard for databases which mean that the decision&nbsp;for the&nbsp;persistence\n    mechanism can be made on day 1 of the project.\n</p>\n<p>\n    On other occasions the decision may point to products that the project team has not yet acquired.&nbsp;If so,&nbsp;the\n    decision needs to be made in time to enable the required products to be made available to the team.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It can often be useful to develop some prototype code to prove that these decisions are sound. The architect should be\n    confident that the technologies being selected are able to fulfill the requirements. The attributes captured against\n    the corresponding analysis mechanisms should be used as criteria to prove the validity of the decisions.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Implementation Mechanism\n</h4>\n<p>\n    An implementation mechanism&nbsp;specifies the actual implementation for the architectural mechanism (hence the\n    name).&nbsp;It can be modeled as a design pattern or presented as&nbsp;example code.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The best time to&nbsp;produce the&nbsp;implementation mechanism is usually when the first piece of functionality that\n    needs it is scheduled for development. Architects and developers work together to develop this.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For examples of the kinds of information that you might capture for a mechanism, see <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/examples/architectural_mechanism_attributes_B0ECA2F7.html\"\n    guid=\"_eQ_s8Om5Edupia_tZIXEqg\">Example: Architectural Mechanism Attributes</a>.\n</p>"

Examples of common architectural problems that might be expressed as mechanisms\n    during analysis are: persistence, transaction management, fault management, messaging, and inference engines. The\n    common aspect of all of these is that each is a general capability of a broad class of systems, and each provides\n    functionality that interacts with or supports the basic application functionality. The Analysis Mechanisms support\n    capabilities required in the basic functional requirements of the system, regardless of the platform that it is\n    deployed upon or the implementation language. Analysis Mechanisms also can be designed and implemented in different\n    ways. Generally, there will be more than one design mechanism that corresponds with each Analysis Mechanism. There may\n    also be more than one way of implementing each design mechanism.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The bottom-up approach is where Analysis Mechanisms ultimately originate. They are created as the you see, perhaps\n    faintly at first, a common theme emerging from a set of solutions to various problems. For example: There is a need to\n    provide a way for elements in different threads to synchronize their clocks, and there is a need for a common way of\n    allocating resources. <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/analysis_mechanism_8369C159.html\"\n    guid=\"_0gvqoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Analysis Mechanism</a>s, which simplify the language of analysis, emerge from these\n    patterns.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Identifying an Analysis Mechanism means that you identify a common, perhaps implicit&nbsp;subproblem, and you give it a\n    name. Initially, the name might be all that exists. For example, the system will require a persistence\n    mechanism.&nbsp;Ultimately, this mechanism will be implemented through the collaboration of various classes, some of\n    which do not deliver application functionality directly, but exist only to support it. Very often these support classes\n    are located in the middle or lower layers of a layered architecture, thereby providing a common support service to all\n    application-level classes.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If the subproblem that you identify is common enough, perhaps a pattern exists from which the mechanism can be\n    instantiated, probably by binding existing classes and implementing new ones, as required by the pattern. An Analysis\n    Mechanism produced this way will be abstract, and it will require further refinement throughout design and\n    implementation work.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You can see examples of how Architectural Mechanisms can be represented in <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/examples/architectural_mechanism_attributes_B0ECA2F7.html\"\n    guid=\"_eQ_s8Om5Edupia_tZIXEqg\">Example: Architectural Mechanism Attributes</a>.\n</p>"

It\n    validates the architecture as an integrated whole through integration tests. The team gains feedback about the\n    architecture from the customer or stakeholder by providing the executable architecture for verification. This way the\n    executable architecture helps to assure that the core functionality is stable enough to build the remainder of the\n    system.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An executable architecture is not a work product. It's an identification or attribute of the implementation,\n    indicating&nbsp;that the implementation&nbsp;contains stable architecturally significant functionality.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    Each version of an executable architecture should be more complete and robust than previous versions. The final\n    executable architecture contains all the elements that make up the architecture and should validate all architecturally\n    significant requirements. There may be rare exceptions where a portion of the architecture can't practically be\n    implemented until later due to uncontrollable circumstances such as constraints with third part software or unique\n    resources that are unavailable.&nbsp;Delaying any part of the architecture should be avoided as it raises significant\n    technical risk later in the project. But if circumstances dictate that some architectural risk can't be mitigated\n    until&nbsp;later in development, a&nbsp;conscious decision can be made to carry this risk forward until the\n    architecture can be fully implemented.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It's also possible to include non-architectural elements into an executable architecture. This will most likely happen\n    when addressing high risk issues early in the development cycle, which is an excellent practice. Two examples of\n    non-technical risks are resource risks and competitive risks. It may be desirable to obtain a difficult-to-get resource\n    early so they can work on a unique piece of the software now, rather than hoping the resource will be available later.\n    Or it may be useful to implement and deploy some early features to maintain market share against a competitor. Think of\n    the executable architecture as a way to mitigate architectural risk, which is the most significant technical risk in a\n    project. From this perspective, it's appropriate to mitigate other risks in the executable architecture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The difference between the executable architecture and the implementation later in the development cycle is that the\n    executable architecture is the result of a period of development (for example&nbsp;an iteration) that's dedicated to\n    elaborating the architecture. Later iterations build onto the executable architecture but are not flagged as an\n    executable architecture because they extend the system's functionality beyond the architectural framework.\n</p>"

                          "<p>\n    Architecturally significant requirements are those requirements that play an important role in determining the\n    architecture of the system.&nbsp; Such requirements require special attention. Not all requirements have equal\n    significance with regards to the architecture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Architecturally significant requirements&nbsp;are a subset of the requirements that need to be satisfied before the\n    architecture can be considered \"stable\". Typically, these are requirements that are technically challenging,\n    technically constraining, or central to the system's purpose. Furthermore, the system will generally be more sensitive\n    to changes&nbsp;against architecturally significant requirements, so identifying and communicating this subset will\n    help others understand the potential implications of change.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Requirements can be explicitly or implicitly architecturally significant. Explicitly significant requirements are often\n    overtly technical in nature, such as performance targets; the need to interface to other systems; the number of users\n    that must be supported; or security requirements. Implicitly significant requirements may define the essence of the\n    functional behaviour of the system (for example, making a purchase from an on-line store).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Deciding whether a specific requirement is architecturally significant is often a matter of judgment. The selection of\n    requirements that are considered \"architecturally significant\" is driven by several key driving factors:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        The benefit of the requirement to stakeholders: critical, <b>important</b>, or <b>useful</b>.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The architectural impact of the requirement: <b>none</b>, <b>extends</b>, or <b>modifies</b>. There may be critical\n        requirements that have little or no impact on the architecture and low-benefit requirements that have a big impact.\n        Low-benefit requirements with big architectural impacts should be reviewed by the project manager for possible\n        removal from the scope of the project.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The risks to be mitigated: performance, availability of a product, and suitability of a component.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The completion of the coverage of the architecture.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Other tactical objectives or constraints, such as demonstration to the user, and so on.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    There may be two requirements that hit the same components and address similar risks. If you implement A first, then B\n    is not architecturally significant. If you implement B first, then A is not architecturally significant. Thus these\n    attributes can depend on the order the requirements are realized, and should be re-evaluated when the order changes, as\n    well as when the requirements themselves change.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The following are good examples of Architecturally Significant Requirements:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        The system must record every modification to customer records for audit purposes.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system must respond within 5 seconds.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system must&nbsp;deploy on Microsoft Windows XP and Linux.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system must encrypt all network traffic.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The ATM system must dispense cash on&nbsp;demand&nbsp;to validated account holders with sufficient cleared funds.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Architecturally significant requirements also describe key behaviors that the system needs to perform.&nbsp; Such\n    scenarios represent the important interactions between key abstractions.and should be identified as architecturally\n    significant requirements. For example, for an on-line book store describing the way the software handles the scenarios\n    for ordering a book and checking out the shopping cart are often enough to communicate the essence of the architecture.\n</p><br />\n<br />\n<br />"

                          "<p align=\"center\">\n    <img height=\"229\" alt=\"visual modeling\" src=\"core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/resources/visual.gif\" width=\"447\" />\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    Visual modeling raises the level of abstraction\n</p>\n<p>\n    Visual modeling is the use of semantically rich, graphical and textual design notations to capture software designs. A\n    notation, such as UML, allows the level of abstraction to be raised, while maintaining rigorous syntax and semantics.\n    In this way, it improves communication in the design team, as the design is formed and reviewed, allowing the reader to\n    reason about the design, and it provides an unambiguous basis for implementation.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    How visual models help\n</h3>\n<p>\n    A model is a simplified view of a system. It shows the essentials of the system from a particular perspective and hides\n    the nonessential details. Visual models help you:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Increase understanding of complex systems\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Explore and compare design alternatives at a low cost\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Form a foundation for implementation\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Capture requirements precisely\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Communicate decisions unambiguously\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Increase understanding of complex systems\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The importance of models increases as systems become more complex. For example, you can build a doghouse without\n    blueprints. However, as you progress to building houses and then to skyscrapers, your need for blueprints becomes\n    pronounced.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Similarly, a small application built by one person in a few days may be easily understood in its entirety. However, an\n    e&nbsp;-&nbsp;commerce system with tens of thousands of source lines of code (SLOCs) or an air traffic control system\n    with hundreds of thousands of SLOCs can no longer be easily understood by one person. Constructing models allows a\n    developer to focus on the big picture, understand how components interact, and identify fatal flaws.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    Among the various types of models are these examples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Use cases to specify behavior unambiguously\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Class diagrams and data model diagrams to capture design\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        State transition diagrams to model dynamic behavior\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Modeling is important because it helps the team visualize, construct, and document the structure and behavior of the\n    system without getting lost in complexity.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Explore and compare design alternatives at a low cost\n</h4>\n<p>\n    You can create and modify simple models inexpensively to explore design alternatives. Innovative ideas can be captured\n    and reviewed by other developers before investing in costly code development. When coupled with iterative development,\n    visual modeling helps developers assess design changes and communicate these changes to the entire development team.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Form a foundation for implementation\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Today, many projects employ object-oriented programming languages to build reusable, change-tolerant, and stable\n    systems. To get these benefits, it is even more important to use object technology in design.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The creation of visual models, whether&nbsp;on paper; around a whiteboard; or in a modeling tool,&nbsp;can help a team\n    to gain agreement on key aspects of the system before investing time&nbsp;in proving&nbsp;their ideas&nbsp;with code.\n    Having a shared model of the system promotes collaboration within the team, encouraging everyone to work towards the\n    same goal.\n</p>\n<p>\n    With the support of appropriate tools, you can use a design model to generate an initial code for implementation. This\n    is referred to as <strong>forward engineering</strong> or <strong>code generation</strong>. You can also enhance design\n    models to include enough information to build the system.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Reverse engineering</strong> may also be applied to generate design models from existing implementations. You\n    can use this method to evaluate existing implementations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Round-trip engineering</strong> combines both forward and reverse engineering techniques to ensure consistent\n    design and code. Combined with an iterative process and the right tools, round-trip engineering allows you to\n    synchronize the design and code during each iteration.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Capture requirements precisely\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Before building a system, it's critical to capture the requirements. Specifying the requirements using a precise and\n    unambiguous model helps to ensure that all stakeholders can understand and agree on the requirements.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A model that separates the external behavior of the system from the implementation of it helps you focus on the\n    intended use of the system, without getting bogged down in implementation details.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Communicate decisions unambiguously\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is&nbsp;a consistent notation that can be applied for system engineering, as well\n    as for business engineering. According to these excerpts from the UML specification, a standard notation::\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Serves as a language for communicating decisions that are not obvious or cannot be inferred from the code\n            itself.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Provides semantics that are rich enough to capture all important strategic and tactical decisions.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Offers a form concrete enough for humans to reason [about] and for tools to manipulate.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    UML represents the convergence of the best practice in software modeling throughout the object-technology industry.

Make sure that you understand why you are\n        modeling something and who will benefit.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Communicate key architectural perspectives:</strong> Even if you choose to model very little&nbsp;of your\n        design, it is often advantageous to produce diagrams that communicate the key architectural aspects of the system.\n        Conveying the \"big picture\" to the rest of the team helps them understand the overall approach and develop cohesive\n        software.&nbsp;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Sketch the design:</strong> Not all models need to be detailed completely and presented in a software\n        modeling tool. It is often perfectly acceptable (if not desirable) to produce hand-drawn sketches on paper or on a\n        whiteboard when you are exploring and communicating the architecture and design with your team. You can use a\n        digital camera or an electronic whiteboard to capture these diagrams and share them. For many small projects, this\n        is often all you need. See <a href=\"http://www.agilemodeling.com/\">http://www.agilemodeling.com/</a> for more\n        information.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Use a modeling tool as needed</strong>:&nbsp;If the team members are changing models throughout the\n        project, sharing patterns/structure, debugging design, describing behavior, etc., then static photos or paper will\n        become difficult to work with. The team may want to capture design in a software modeling tool. Other than\n        communicating the design to the team, another benefit of a such a tool is the&nbsp;generation of structural code\n        from the models. Many software development tools allow you to view the code as models, making it easier to\n        comprehend static and dynamic aspects of a complex code base.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Agree on a standard notation:</strong> In a team environment, it is important that others can understand\n        your diagrams without much explanation. Choosing a standard notation enables others to quickly comprehend your\n        diagrams without ambiguity. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides an industry-standard approach to software\n        modeling and is an example of a widely understood notation.\n    </li>\n</ul>For more information, see <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\nhref=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/visual_modeling_2C089766.html\"\nguid=\"_0XY6UMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Concept: Visual Modeling</a>.<br />"

                      "<h4>\n    Origins\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The idea of patterns as it is now applied to software design comes from the work of Christopher Alexander. He has\n    written widely on the subject of applying patterns to the design and construction of towns and buildings. Two of his\n    books, <em>A Pattern Language</em> [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">ALE77</a>] and <em>The Timeless Way of Building</em> [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">ALE79</a>] have had the greatest impact on the software community and the adoption of\n    software patterns for the design of software. His concepts of patterns and pattern language provide a model for the\n    capture of software design expertise in a form that can then be reapplied in recurring situations.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<h4>\n    A definition of patterns\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Today, the most commonly used definition of software patterns is from [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">GAM95</a>]:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        \"A design pattern describes the problem, a solution to the problem consisting of a general arrangement of objects\n        and classes, when to apply the solution, and the consequences of applying the solution.\"\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    This definition often serves only as a starting point, however. A richer definition, based on Alexander's work, is\n    offered by Gabriel in his book, <em>A Timeless Way of Hacking</em> [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">ALU03</a>], in which each pattern is a three-part rule that expresses relationships\n    among a certain context, a certain system of forces that occur repeatedly in that context, and a certain software\n    configuration that allows these forces to resolve themselves.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Describing patterns\n</h4>\n<p>\n    It is commonplace to describe patterns&nbsp;using the&nbsp;format made popular by Erich Gamma and his three colleagues\n    [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">GAM95</a>]. They have come to be known as the Gang of Four (GoF); therefore, their\n    description is known as the <strong>GoF format</strong>. The GoF format uses the following keywords to describe\n    object-oriented design patterns:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Pattern name and classification:</strong> Naming the pattern allows design to work at a higher level of\n            abstraction, using a vocabulary of patterns. Gamma says that finding a good name is one of the hardest problems\n            of developing a catalogue of patterns (see <strong>Pattern catalogues</strong> later in this section).\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Intent:</strong> An answer to questions such as: What does the pattern do? What problem does it\n            address?\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Also known as:</strong> Other names for the pattern.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Motivation:</strong> A concrete scenario that illustrates a design problem and how the pattern solves\n            the problem.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Applicability:</strong> Instructions for how you can recognize situations in which patterns are\n            applicable.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Structure:</strong> A graphical representation of the classes in the pattern.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Participants:</strong> The responsibilities of the classes and objects that participate in the pattern.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Collaborations:</strong> How participants collaborate to fulfill their responsibilities.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Consequences:</strong> The results, side effects and trade offs caused by using the pattern.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Implementation:</strong> Guidance on the implementation of the pattern.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Sample code:</strong> Code fragments that illustrate the pattern's implementation.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Known uses:</strong> Where to find real-world examples of the pattern.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Related patterns:</strong> Synergies, differences, and other pattern relationships.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Although the GoF format is specifically intended for object-oriented development, you can use it, with slight\n    modification, to address other software patterns. A more general keyword format for software patterns based on\n    Alexander's principles uses keywords such as <em>problem</em>, <em>context</em>, <em>forces</em> and <em>solution</em>.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Pattern catalogs\n</h4>\n<p>\n    To assist with the identification and selection of patterns, various classification schemes have been proposed. One of\n    the early schemes, proposed by Buschmann and his associates, [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">BUS96</a>] uses three classifiers: granularity, functionality, and structured\n    principles. Of those three classifiers, it is their granularity classifier that has remained popular. Granularity\n    classifies patterns into three levels of abstraction:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Architectural patterns:</strong> Architectural patterns express the fundamental structure of a software\n            scheme. Examples of architectural pattern include: layers, pipes and filters, and the model view controller\n            pattern.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Design patterns:</strong> Software architecture usually consists of smaller architectural units that\n            are described by design patterns. The GoF pattern is an example of a design pattern.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Idioms.</strong> An idiom is the lowest-level pattern, and it is specific to a programming language.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Buschmann and his colleagues introduced four groups for categorizing architectural patterns:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Structure\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Distributed systems\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Interactive systems\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Adaptable systems\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The following table shows the categorization of their architectural patterns.\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"85%\" summary=\"Categories for Architectural Patterns [BUS96]\" border=\"1\"\nvalign=\"top\">\n    <caption>\n        <strong>Categories for Architectural Patterns<br />\n        </strong>\n    </caption>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <th scope=\"col\">\n                <div align=\"center\">\n                    <strong>Category</strong>\n                </div>\n            </th>\n            <th scope=\"col\">\n                <div align=\"center\">\n                    <strong>Pattern</strong>\n                </div>\n            </th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                Structure\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>\n                    Layers<br />\n                    Pipes and filters<br />\n                    Blackboard\n                </p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                Distributed systems\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                Broker\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                Interactive systems\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                Model view controller<br />\n                Presentation abstraction control\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                <p>\n                    Adaptable systems\n                </p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>\n                    Reflection<br />\n                    Micro kernel\n                </p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n    For design patterns, Gamma's group categorized their design patterns by purpose, using three categories:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Creational\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Structural\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Behavioral\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Pattern languages\n</h4>\n<p>\n    In addition to the concept of patterns, Alexander also gave the software community the concept of a pattern language.\n    The purpose of developing a pattern language was to provide a vocabulary of design principles (patterns) that would\n    allow those who work, study, or live in buildings to communicate effectively with the planners and designers of those\n    buildings. Alexander explains that when using a pattern language:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        We always use it as a sequence, going through the patterns, moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\n        always from the ones that create structure to the ones which then embellish those structures, and then to those\n        that embellish the embellishments.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    In applying patterns in this way, Alexander advocated the use of generative pattern languages, ones that, given an\n    initial context, would always lead to good design.&nbsp; Alexander&nbsp;states:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        Thus, as in the case of natural languages, the pattern language is generative. It not only tells us the rules of\n        arrangement, but shows us how to construct arrangements - as many as we want - which satisfies the rules.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    In the application of software patterns, pattern names provide a vocabulary for the communication of software ideas.\n    The sequential application of patterns finds application in software design processes, both waterfall and iterative,\n    that successively apply architectural patterns, and then design patterns, and, finally, idioms to design and implement\n    a software system. Software processes, however, rely on the skills of the Architect and Developer roles to guide the\n    application of patterns, rather than a generative pattern language.\n</p>"

                      "<p>\n    Maximizing reuse has always been an important goal of software development. It's better to re-use than to expend the\n    cost of creating something new, testing it, and releasing it for the first time with the risk of hidden problems that\n    all new software has. Languages, particularly object-oriented ones, have been developed to make reuse easier. But a\n    language alone isn't enough to provide cost effective reuse. The bulk of reusable software comes from skilled\n    developers and architects who are able to identify and leverage reuse opportunities.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    What is a Reusable Asset?\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The following are some examples of reusable software assets:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Architectural frameworks\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Architectural mechanisms\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Architectural decisions\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Constraints\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Applications\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Components\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        COTS software&nbsp;\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Identifying Reuse Opportunities\n</h3>\n<p>\n    There are three perspectives to look at when reusing software: code (implementation), design, and framework or\n    architecture.&nbsp; Architects should look to reuse significant application frameworks such as layers that can be\n    applied to many different types of applications (for more information, see <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/layering_F169CF07.html\"\n    guid=\"_0gpkAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Guideline: Layering</a>. Developers should look to designs and <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html\"\n    guid=\"_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Pattern</a>s that can be reused to produce desired behavior or robust structures. They\n    should also look at how to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written by leveraging stable components and code\n    that has been proven in production environments.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The best way to enable a team to find opportunities for reuse is to exercise excellent design and coding practices.\n    It's difficult to find code and design that can be reused when dealing with large classes, classes that don't have a\n    clearly defined focus, or classes with relationships that are difficult to understand. Classes should be small, easy to\n    understand, and highly cohesive to make it easier to identify reuse opportunities. Any functionality that can be\n    reasonably separated into another class should be. Another way of saying this is that any concept that could be applied\n    to more than one type of class should be its own class.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For example, if some calculations are added to an existing class, it may make sense to then refactor those calculations\n    into a new helper class. Those calculations can&nbsp;then be re-used in any number of other classes without the burden\n    of having to know about the functionality of the original class.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The simplest but least efficient way to identify reuse opportunities is to \"smell\" similar code. A developer may recall\n    doing something similar to what they're designing or implementing now. Once the previous implementation has been\n    discovered or recalled it can be reused. Developers will always find reuse opportunities this way. But the unstructured\n    nature of it won't maximize the potential areas for reuse.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Collaboration is a good technique for identifying reuse opportunities. It provides a structure where identifying reuse\n    - instead of writing code - is the goal of the exercise. And the more brains that are looking for reuse opportunities,\n    the more likely it is that they'll be found. A brainstorming or review meeting that focuses on identifying reuse\n    opportunities would be useful to support this.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Patterns are good ways to find reuse opportunities in designs and frameworks. See <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html\"\n    guid=\"_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Concept: Pattern</a>&nbsp;for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Analyzing behavior is another good way to identify potential areas for reuse. Analyze how classes need to collaborate\n    in order to deliver some specific functionality such as a requirement or feature. This collaboration can be documented\n    in sequence (behavior) and class (structure) diagrams and can be reused in similar circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>\n    After looking for similar behavior and returned values, then look for similarity of parameters. If their\n    interfaces&nbsp;are not an exact match for the component interfaces being proposed, you can modify the\n    proposed&nbsp;signatures to increase the degree of reuse. Some design mechanisms, such as performance or security\n    requirements, may disqualify a component from reuse even when there is&nbsp;a perfect match between operation\n    signatures.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n    A common set of components may exist that provides many of the <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/arch_mechanism_2932DFB6.html\"\n    guid=\"_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA\">Architectural Mechanism</a> that you need&nbsp;for the new system. These components may\n    be available either because they were developed or purchased previously for&nbsp;similar systems. Given their\n    suitability and compatibility within the software architecture, there may be a need to reverse-engineer these\n    components to represent them in a design model and reuse them in a project.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n    Similar thinking applies to&nbsp;existing databases. Part of the information to be used by the application under\n    development may already reside in a database. You may be able to get the classes that represent the database structures\n    that hold this information by reverse-engineering the database.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <a class=\"elementLink\" href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/refactoring_1B63BA3B.html\"\n    guid=\"_Poc7IPDzEdqYgerqi84oCA\">Refactoring</a> should always be considered when reusing code. Code (or design) is often\n    not originally written for re-use, or reusable code may not be a perfect fit for a new situation.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Assessing and Selecting Assets to Reuse\n</h3>\n<p>\n    To assess and select assets to reuse on your project, you need to understand the requirements of the system's\n    environment. You also need to understand the scope and general functionality of the system that the stakeholders\n    require. There are several types of assets to consider, including (but not limited to): reference architectures;\n    frameworks; patterns; analysis mechanisms; classes; and experience. You can search asset&nbsp;repositories (internal or\n    external to your organization) and industry literature to identify assets or similar projects.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You need to assess whether available assets contribute to solving the key challenges of the current project and whether\n    they are compatible with the project's architectural constraints. You also need to analyze the extent of the fit\n    between assets and requirements, considering whether any of the requirements are negotiable (to enable use of the\n    asset). Also, assess whether the asset could be modified or extended to satisfy requirements, as well as what the\n    tradeoffs in adopting it are, in terms of cost, risk, and functionality.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Leverage reuse of existing components by evaluating their interfaces and the behavior that they provide. Reuse\n    components when their interfaces are similar or match the interfaces of components you would need to develop from\n    scratch. If not similar, modify the newly identified interfaces so you improve the fit with existing components\n    interfaces. Work with developers to gain consensus on the suitability of using existing components.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Finally, decide, in principle, whether to use one or more assets, and record the rationale for this decision.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Reuse Techniques\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Reuse can be performed differently depending on the capabilities of the implementation environment. The simplest\n    technique is to copy the code from one place to another. This isn't advisable because it's not really reuse. Multiple\n    copies of source code are difficult to maintain and can eventually diverge from each other. Reuse is about using the\n    same code to perform similar tasks as a way to increase quality and reduce overhead.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Some languages, such as C++, support templates. Templates, sometimes referred to as parameterized code, are a precursor\n    to patterns. Templates are code with parameters that are applied just when the code's needed, at compile time. The C++\n    Standard Template Library (STL) is one example. It provides many types of reusable containers (lists, sets, safe\n    arrays, etc) that don't have some of the drawbacks of inheritance. Templates such as these are also useful as mix-in\n    classes in languages like C++ that support multiple inheritance. Because mix-ins are implemented as templates, they\n    allow for a type of multiple inheritance without the baggage.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Inheritance and Aggregation\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Inheritance (also known as generalization) is an easy way to implement polymorphism and has been used as the primary\n    mechanism for reuse in modern object-oriented languages. This is unfortunate, as inheritance imposes a rigid structure\n    on the software's design that is difficult to change. Any inheritance hierarchy that shares code from parents to\n    children will have problems when it grows to be three or more levels deep. Too many exceptions occur to maintain a pure\n    \"is-a\" relationship between parents and children, where children are always considered to have all the properties and\n    behaviors of the parents. Inheritance should be used to share definitions (interfaces), not implementations. Years of\n    difficulties with inheriting implementations have made this practice a primary object-oriented design principle.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Whenever inheritance is used, it is best to have only the last child class (leaf node) of the inheritance hierarchy be\n    instantiated. All parent classes should be abstract. This is because a class that tries to be both reusable and\n    concrete - to provide reusable and specific behavior at the same time - almost always fails to fulfill either goal.\n    This is a dimension of cohesiveness. One thing that makes a class cohesive is that it's dedicated to reuse or dedicated\n    to a specific implementation, but not both.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Aggregation is a technique that collects or aggregates functionality into larger elements of functionality. It provides\n    a structure that's far more flexible and reusable than inheritance. It's better to reuse implementation and design by\n    aggregating small pieces of functionality together rather than trying to inherit the functionality from a parent.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You may also find reuse opportunities by reviewing interfaces. If interfaces describe similar behavior it may be\n    possible to eliminate one of the interfaces, have just one implementation realize both interfaces, or refactor the\n    interfaces to put redundant content in a new, simpler interface.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Finding Reusable Code\n</h3>\n<p>\n    There are many sources of reusable code beyond what the developers are writing for a specific project. Other places\n    from which to harvest code include the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Internal (corporate) code libraries\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Third party libraries\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Built-in language libraries\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Code samples from tutorials, examples, books, etc.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Local code guru or knowledgeable colleague\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Existing system code\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Open source products (be sure to follow any licensing agreements)\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Also, many tools that generate code will generate comprehensive code based on minimal specification. For example, a\n    design tool might generate the member variable plus a get and a set operation when the designer specifies an attribute.\n    Other more sophisticated tools with knowledge of a specific framework can generate voluminous code to ensure that a\n    class conforms to the framework. An example of this would be a tool that generates significant additional code when a\n    class is marked as a Java entity bean. This sort of consistent transformation from a specification (the design) to an\n    implementation (the code) could be considered a form of code reuse as well.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Don't Reuse Everything\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Reuse makes code and design cheap to use but expensive to build. It requires experience and thoughtful consideration to\n    create an implementation or design that's abstract enough for others to re-use, but concrete enough to be truly useful.\n    Reusable code must also be maintained. Many organizations have difficulty assigning responsibility for maintaining\n    reusable code if they don't have a group dedicated to reuse.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It's usually not a good idea to create code or designs for reuse unless you know it's going to be reused. It's better\n    to refactor software to be more reusable after it's discovered that they can be reused. One rule of thumb is to write\n    for reuse only when you know you'll use it at least 3 times. Otherwise the cost of building and maintaining that part\n    of the software will not be recovered by reduced overhead in other areas of development.\n</p>"

                      "<p>\n    When identifying the elements for a scenario of system behavior, you can align each participating element with one of\n    three key perspectives: <b>Entity</b>, <b>Control</b>, or <b>Boundary</b>. Although specifics of languages, frameworks,\n    and heuristics of quality design will drive the final design, a first cut that covers required system behavior can\n    always be assembled with elements of these three perspectives.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This pattern is similar to the Model View Controller pattern (described here [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#BUS96\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">BUS96</a>] and here [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#WIKP-MVC\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">WIKP-MVC</a>], among other places), but the Entity Control Boundary (ECB) pattern is not\n    solely appropriate for dealing with user interfaces, and it gives the controller a slightly different role to play.\n</p>\n<h4 align=\"left\">\n    ECB&nbsp;pattern example\n</h4>\n<p>\n    &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/resources/ebc_diagram.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Entity elements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    An entity is a long-lived, passive element that is responsible for some meaningful chunk of information. This is not to\n    say that entities are \"data,\" while other design elements are \"function.\" Entities perform behavior organized around\n    some cohesive amount of data.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An example of an entity for a customer service application is a Customer entity that manages all information about a\n    customer. A design element for&nbsp;this entity would include data about the customer, behavior to manage the data,\n    behavior to validate customer information&nbsp;and to perform other business calculations, such as \"Is this customer\n    allowed to purchase product X?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n    The identification of the entities as part of this pattern can be done many times at different levels of abstraction\n    from the code, at different levels of granularity in size, and from the perspectives of different contexts. For\n    example, you could do an analysis pass on a scenario of creating a marketing campaign and identify the customer element\n    with various customer data elements, such as name and address, plus various required behaviors, such as the management\n    of the name and address data and the ability to rate the customer based on some algorithm (such an application of this\n    pattern would be abstract from code, coarse-grained, and have no specific context). Later, you could do a pass on the\n    same scenario applying an architectural mechanism for database access that breaks the address out as its own element,\n    moves the responsibility for storing and retrieving customers to a new control element, and identifies specific\n    database decisions, such as the use of primary keys in the entities. (Such an application of this pattern would be\n    closer to the code, finer-grained, and aligned with a database&nbsp;context.)\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Control elements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    A control element manages the flow of interaction of the scenario. A control element could manage the end-to-end\n    behavior of a scenario or it could manage the interactions between a subset of the elements. Behavior and business\n    rules relating to the information relevant to the scenario should be assigned to the entities; the control elements are\n    responsible only for the flow of the scenario.\n</p>\n<p>\n    CreateMarketingCampaign is an example of a control element for a customer service application. This design element\n    would&nbsp;be responsive to certain front-end boundary elements and would collaborate with other entities,\n    control&nbsp;elements, and back-end boundary elements to support the creation of a marketing campaign.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As with the entity example here, there might be many passes over the identification of control elements. A first pass\n    might be an analysis pass that identifies one control element for a scenario, with behavior to make sure that the\n    design can support the flow of events. A&nbsp;subsequent pass might find controllers to manage reusable collaborations\n    of low-level elements that will map to a specific code&nbsp;unit to be written.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Boundary elements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    A boundary element lies on the periphery of a system or subsystem, but within it. For any scenario being considered\n    either across the whole system or within some subsystem, some boundary elements will be \"front end\" elements that\n    accept input from outside of the area under design, and other elements will be \"back end,\" managing communication to\n    supporting elements outside of the system or subsystem.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Two examples of boundary elements for a customer service application might be a front end MarketingCampaignForm and a\n    back end BudgetSystem element. The MarketingCampaignForm would manage the exchange of information between a user and\n    the system, and the BudgetSystem would manage the exchange of information between the system and an external system\n    that manages budgets.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If the system communicates with another system (where that system could be anything from software to hardware units\n    that the current system will use, such as printers, terminals, alarm devices, and sensors).&nbsp; An analysis pass\n    could identify one boundary element for each external relevant to a scenario.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Example:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        An automated teller machine (ATM) must communicate with the ATM network to ascertain whether a customer's bank\n        number and PIN are correct, and whether the customer has sufficient funds to withdrawal the requested amount. The\n        ATM network is an external system (from the perspective of the ATM); therefore, you would use a\n        <strong>boundary</strong> class to represent it in a use-case analysis.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Subsequently, these could be broken down into multiple boundary elements or small communities made up of collaborating\n    elements of all three stereotypes. If the interfaces with the system are simple and well-defined, a single class may be\n    sufficient to represent the external system. Often, however, these interfaces are too complex to be represented by\n    using a single class; they often require complex collaborations of many classes. Moreover, interfaces between systems\n    are often highly reusable across applications. As a result, in many cases, a component models the system interfaces\n    more appropriately.&nbsp; The use of a component allows the interface to the external system to be defined and\n    stabilized, while leaving the design details of the system interface hidden as the system evolves.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Walking through the scenario\n</h3>\n<p>\n    You can walk through a scenario initiated by something outside of the boundaries of the system or subsystem being\n    designed and distribute the responsibility to perform behavior supporting the scenario to the elements identified of\n    each type. The appropriate design element responsible for each action in the scenario will be as described in the\n    definition of each of the element types described here previously.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In addition to identifying the behavior necessary to perform the scenario, the initiation of this behavior from design\n    element to design element identifies the necessary relationships. There are certain appropriate relations between the\n    participating elements. An element can communicate with other elements of the same kind. Control elements can\n    communicate with each of the other two kinds, but entities and boundary elements should not communicate directly.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This table shows appropriate links between design elements.\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"400\" summary=\"Appropriate Links\" border=\"1\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n            </td>\n            <th scope=\"col\">\n                <center>\n                    Entity\n                </center>\n            </th>\n            <th scope=\"col\">\n                <center>\n                    Boundary\n                </center>\n            </th>\n            <th scope=\"col\">\n                <center>\n                    Control\n                </center>\n            </th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th scope=\"row\">\n                Entity\n            </th>\n            <td>\n                <center>\n                    X\n                </center>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <center>\n                    X\n                </center>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th scope=\"row\">\n                Boundary\n            </th>\n            <td>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <center>\n                    X\n                </center>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th scope=\"row\">\n                Control\n            </th>\n            <td>\n                <center>\n                    X\n                </center>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <center>\n                    X\n                </center>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <center>\n                    X\n                </center>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n    By applying this pattern, you can put a robust design together that identifies the elements, behavior, and\n    relationships necessary to support a scenario.\n</p>"

Refactoring instead changes the role of up-front design, allowing the strictly design work to be more\n    abstract. Small-scale, very tactical decisions can be made during the implementation of the solution with confidence\n    that refactoring will ensure a quality implementation at that level. The designing of the solution before\n    implementation will be more lightweight and focused on broad factors that will drive the implementation.\n</p>\n<p>\n    There is an additional benefit of refactoring: it changes the way a developer thinks about the implementation when not\n    refactoring. The basic task of implementing a solution becomes solely about getting the solution to pass its developer\n    tests in the simplest way possible. Then the design of that solution can be examined and refactored separately. Even if\n    these two things -- implementation of the solution and then improvement -- are just a minute apart, it can be freeing\n    for a developer to single-mindedly create code that causes a test to pass, and then separately single-mindedly improve\n    that code.\n</p>\n<p>\n    These are some additional resources:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <a href=\"http://www.refactoring.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><font\n        color=\"#0000ff\">http://www.refactoring.com/</font></u></a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <a href=\"http://www.agiledata.org/essays/databaseRefactoring.html\"><u><font\n        color=\"#0000ff\">http://www.agiledata.org/essays/databaseRefactoring.html</font></u></a>\n    </li>\n</ul>"

                      "<p>\n    Layering&nbsp; is&nbsp;one of the most&nbsp;commonly used&nbsp;approaches for structuring and decomposing systems.\n    Layering logically partitions the system into sets of components with certain rules regarding how relationships can be\n    formed between them. Layering provides a way to restrict inter-subsystem dependencies, with the result that the system\n    is more loosely coupled and more easily maintained.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Consider the number and purpose of the layers carefully. Do not over-complicate the solution by defining more layers\n    than are needed to meet the needs of the solution. More layers can always be added in the future to meet new\n    requirements. Removing layers is not always as easy and may introduce risks into the project.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The criteria for grouping elements into layers follows a few patterns:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Visibility</b><strong>:</strong> Elements may depend only on components in the same layer and the next-lower\n        layer.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Volatility</b><strong>:</strong>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <b>In the highest layers</b>, put elements that vary when user requirements change.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <b>In the lowest layers</b>, put elements that vary when the implementation platform changes (hardware,\n                language, operating system, database, and so forth).\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <strong>Sandwiched in the middle</strong>, put elements that are generally applicable across wide ranges of\n                systems and implementation environments.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <strong>Add layers</strong> when additional partitions within these broad categories help to organize the\n                model.\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Generality</b><strong>:</strong> Abstract elements tend to be placed in the lower layers. If not\n        implementation-specific, they tend to gravitate toward the middle layers.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Number of layers.</b> For a small system, three layers are typically sufficient.&nbsp;A three-layer architecture\n        of&nbsp;Presentation, Business, and Data layers is very common in information systems.&nbsp; For a complex system,\n        five to seven layers could be appropriate. For any degree of complexity, more than 10 layers should be viewed with\n        suspicion that increases with the number of layers.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Failure to restrict dependencies according to the visibility criteria mentioned above can cause architectural\n    degradation and make the system difficult to extend and maintain.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Allowable exceptions to the visibility rule include cases where components need direct access to lower-layer services\n    beyond the next-lower layer. Make a decision about how to handle primitive services that are needed throughout the\n    system, such as printing, sending messages, and so forth. There is little value in restricting messages to lower layers\n    if the solution is to effectively implement call pass-throughs in the intermediate layers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This usage of a\n    less strict rule on dependencies down through the layers is sometimes called a Relaxed Layered Architecture (<a\n    class=\"elementlinkwithusertext\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#BUS96\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">[BUS96]</a>).\n</p>\n<h4>\n    <a id=\"PartitioningPatterns\" name=\"PartitioningPatterns\">Partitioning patterns</a>\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Within the top layers of the system, additional partitioning may help organize the model. The following guidelines for\n    partitioning present different issues to consider:\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>User organization</b><strong>:</strong> Elements may be organized along lines that mirror the organization of\n    functionality in the business organization (partitioning occurs along departmental or user role lines). This\n    partitioning often occurs early in the design&nbsp;due to&nbsp;an existing enterprise model that is strongly\n    partitioned according to the structure of the organization. This pattern usually affects only the top few layers of\n    application-specific services and can often disappear as the design evolves.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Partitioning along user-organization lines can be a good starting point for the model.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            The structure of the user organization is not stable over a long period of time because business\n            reorganizations occur; therefore, it is not a good long-term basis for system partitioning. The internal\n            organization of the system should enable the system to evolve and be maintained independently of the\n            organization of the business that it supports.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    <b>Areas of competence and skills:</b> Elements may be organized to partition responsibilities among different groups\n    within the development organization. Typically, this occurs in the middle and lower layers of the system, and reflects\n    the need for specialization in skills during the development and support of an infrastructure based on complex\n    technology. Examples of such technologies include network and distribution management, database management,\n    communication management, and process control, among others. Partitioning along competence lines may also occur in\n    upper layers, where special competency in the problem domain is required to understand and support key business\n    functionality. Examples include telecommunication call management, securities trading, insurance claims processing, and\n    air traffic control, to name a few.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>System distribution:</b> Within any of the layers of the system, the layers may be further partitioned horizontally,\n    so to speak, to reflect the distribution of functionality.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Partitioning to reflect distribution of functionality can help you visualize the network communication that\n            will occur as the system runs.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Partitioning to reflect distribution can also, however, make the system more difficult to change if the\n            deployment model changes significantly.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    <b>Secrecy areas</b><strong>:</strong> Some applications, especially those requiring special security clearance to\n    develop or support, require additional partitioning according to security access privileges. Software that controls\n    access to secrecy areas must be developed and maintained by personnel with appropriate clearance. If the number of\n    people with this background on the project is limited, the functionality requiring special clearance must be\n    partitioned into subsystems that will be developed independently from other subsystems, with the interfaces to the\n    secrecy areas the only visible aspect of these subsystems.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Variability areas:</b> Functionality that is likely to be optional, and therefore delivered only in some variants of\n    the system, should be organized into independent components that are developed and delivered independently from the\n    mandatory functionality of the system.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    This example illustrates how the use-case model and associated use-case specification will evolve during the lifecycle.\n    It shows the state of the use case model at two points in the lifecycle: early inception and towards the end of\n    elaboration. The purpose is to illustrate how one would identify, outline and detail requirements so as to maximize\n    stakeholder value and minimize risk early in the project, as well as to minimize re-work later.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    The example uses an Automated Teller Machine as the example system, because it is familiar to most people. This\n    familiarity simplifies understanding the principles without getting lost in domain specific terminology.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Early inception\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Assume you have just started on the project as the Analyst. You have identified the key stakeholders and met with them\n    to discuss their needs. During your meetings, you identified a number of key actors, use cases, and supporting\n    requirements for the ATM system. You captured the use cases and actors, with names and brief descriptions only, in the\n    use-case model. An example of this work is given in the document <strong>ATM UC Model Inception</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Prior to committing significant time to detailing these use cases now, you recognize that a \"breadth before depth\"\n    approach can save you valuable time and permit you to identify the highest value and highest risk items so that you can\n    concentrate on those first.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You hold a brainstorming session with the stakeholders and outline the basic flow of each of the main use cases. As you\n    are working through, you may identify some additional alternative flows. Fight the urge to \"dive-in\" to the details on\n    these alternative flows at this point, simply list them and come back later when you have a better understanding of the\n    \"big picture\".\n</p>\n<p>\n    Examples of the notes you took during this exercise are attached (<strong>Withdraw Cash Outline</strong>,\n    <strong>Deposit Funds Outline</strong> and <strong>Transfer</strong> <strong>Funds Outline</strong>).<br />\n    <b>Note:</b> the choice of font is intentional to illustrate that these are notes, not formal documents.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Reviewing your notes, you recognize that there is some behavior that is common to most of the use cases, namely the\n    steps required to validate the Bank Customer. Factoring this behavior out into an &lt;&lt;included&gt;&gt; use case\n    will simplify communications, iteration planning, and maintenance.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You update the use case model accordingly: <strong>ATM UC Model Elaboration</strong>.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Elaboration\n</h4>\n<p>\n    With a better understanding of the system, you can now prioritize your effort to maximize value and minimize risk. You\n    start by detailing the common behavior captured in the use case: Validate User. This use case captures key\n    architectural requirements that will exercise a significant portion of the system (communications with the Bank, card\n    reader interface, and so on). Implementing this one key scenario will go a long way to reducing risk.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An example of the Validate User use-case specification is attached: <strong>Use Case Spec - Validate User.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Note that there may still be some un-answered questions, but that's OK. Capture these directly in the use-case\n    specification and get them answered (see Section 5.6 of the <strong>Validate User UC Specification</strong>, for an\n    example).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Continuing with another architecturally significant thread, you detail the basic flow and some key alternative flows of\n    the use case: Withdraw Cash. You know that if the team can implement this, much of the other functionality will be low\n    risk.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An example of the Withdraw Cash use-case specification is attached:&nbsp;<strong>Use Case Spec - Withdraw\n    Cash</strong>.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Summary\n</h3>\n<p>\n    By following a breadth before depth approach to outlining and detailing use cases, you can make better decisions on\n    priorities. Start by identifying actors. Then for each actor, ask \"What is the main purpose this actor would like to\n    use the system?\". This will lead to the identification of the use cases. Capture the actors and use cases in the\n    use-case model along with a brief description.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Prioritize the use cases, and then draft the main scenario or basic flow. As you are working through this you may\n    identify alternate flows (what can go wrong, what options are available, and so on). Capture these, along with a brief\n    description.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Review the use-case model and reprioritize and assess risk. For the high priority (based on value to the stakeholders)\n    or high risk use cases,&nbsp;detail the main scenario and the critical alternate flows.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you follow this approach, you will increase the likelihood of delivering value early, minimizing risk, and\n    minimizing re-work.<br />\n</p>"

                          "<p>\n    The iteration burndown report is the primary tool for understanding the status of the current iteration. It shows the\n    trend for how much work is left to do within the iteration. This is accomplished by adding the estimated effort left\n    for each of the work items to be addressed within the iteration, and showing how the estimated effort is changing over\n    the duration of the iteration. The iteration backlog should be updated frequently, preferably daily.\n</p>\n<p>\n    These factors affect the team's assessment of how much work remains:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Work that has been completed, which means there is less work remaining\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The developer responsible for a work item changes the assessment of effort required to complete the work item. This\n        should be expected, because you typically understand what it really takes to complete a task after you have done a\n        subset of the task. It is common for estimates of the work remaining to increase in the beginning of the iteration,\n        especially for inexperienced teams, because they often underestimate efforts. Expect estimates to continue changing\n        as teams become more experienced, but the modifications are upward as often as downward.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Daily or frequent updates of the iteration burndown report allow the team to react to changes. For example, changes can\n    include cutting the project scope by removing work items from the iteration, reducing the ambition level associated\n    with a work item, or finding better ways of approaching work items (such as having an expert team member help with\n    difficult work items).\n</p>\n<p>\n    See <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/examples/iteration_burndown_report_example_1AE62791.html\"\n    guid=\"_GtGisDcGEdyTZ9G7ByfQTw\">Iteration Burndown Report</a> for an example of an iteration burndown report.<br />\n</p>"

This creates a healthy focus on ensuring that whatever is\n    worked on is of value to the stakeholders. Decision making must happen faster than in a process without iterations,\n    because there is no time for endless debate. Iterative development focuses on producing working code, reducing the risk\n    of analysis-paralysis. Frequent demonstration of working code provides feedback mechanisms that allow course\n    corrections to be taken as needed.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Iteration planning, estimation, and progress tracking are centered on work items. The iteration plan is created by\n    selecting the top-priority work items. Agile estimation techniques are used to understand how many work items can\n    safely fit within the time-boxed iteration, and work items are filtered to ensure that the chosen work items will allow\n    the team to deliver upon iteration objectives agreed to by stakeholders. Progress is demonstrated through continuous\n    completion of many small work items (see <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/concepts/micro_increments_C8773066.html\"\n    guid=\"_S80VwCNbEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA\">Micro-Increments</a>).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Just as a project goes through a lifecycle, iterations go through a lifecycle with a different focus for the team,\n    depending on whether you are in the first or the last week of the iteration (see Figure 1 below). An iteration starts\n    with an iteration planning meeting that is a few hours long. The initial one or two days are typically focused on\n    further planning and architecture to, among other things, understand the dependencies and logical ordering of work\n    items, and the architectural impacts of the work to be done. Most of the time during an iteration is spent on executing\n    the micro increments. Each micro increment should deliver tested code to a build, as well as validated artifacts. To\n    give additional discipline, stable builds are produced at the end of each week. More attention is spent on these builds\n    to make sure that the quality is not eroding, and issues are dealt with early so that the success of the iteration\n    isn't jeopardized. The last week or last few days of the iteration typically have a stronger emphasis on polishing and\n    bug fixing than earlier weeks, even though new features are added as appropriate. The goal is to never let quality\n    erode, thus ensuring&nbsp;that a high-quality useful product increment is produced at the end of the iteration. The\n    iteration ends with an assessment (with stakeholders) of what was built, and a retrospective to understand how to\n    improve the process for next iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Figure 1.

A micro-increment\n    represents the outcome of a few hours to a few days of work for one person (or typically a few people collaborating) to\n    reach the goals of the iteration. The concept of a micro-increment helps the individual team member to partition their\n    work into small units, each of which delivers something of measurable value to the team. Micro-increments provide an\n    extremely short feedback loop that drives adaptive decisions within each iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A micro-increment should be well-defined, and you should be able to track daily progress of each micro-increment.\n    Micro-increments are specified and tracked by a work item. Change sets represent the physical outcome in terms of the\n    files that are modified as a part of completing the work item. Let's have a look at some sample micro-increments:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Identify stakeholders<em>.</em></b> Defining a shared vision is a task that can drag on for weeks, so to ensure\n        that you make and track daily progress, divide the task into small and well-defined micro-increments. Describing\n        and getting buy-in on which stakeholders to put into a Vision document is a meaningful result, and may take a few\n        hours or at most a few days, and thus represents a suitable micro-increment.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Develop Solution Increment.</b> Defining, designing, implementing, and testing a use case or even a scenario can\n        take weeks or longer. To ensure continuous progress, divide the work into smaller increments, each of which can be\n        done in a couple of days. A more suitable micro-increment may be to only define, design, implement, and test a\n        subflow of a use-case or step within a scenario.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Agree on Technical Approach for Persistency.</b> Agreeing on your technical solution may take quite some time,\n        so you need to narrow the task to something that can be defined and agreed to in a short time. One way to partition\n        the work is according to the issues that you need to resolve, such as persistency or reporting. This\n        micro-increment will probably involve defining requirements, surveying available assets, prototyping, and\n        documenting the decisions.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Plan Iteration.</b> This micro-increment could include setting up a meeting for creating the iteration plan,\n        doing some preparation for the meeting (such as reviewing candidate work items), coaching the team through the\n        iteration planning meeting, and posting the iteration plan for easy access. The end result is something complete\n        and measurable, a posted plan that has buy-in from the team.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Your project evolves in micro-increments through simultaneous execution of a number of work items. By openly sharing\n    progress on your micro-increments through daily team meetings and team collaboration tools, you achieve the\n    transparency and insight into each other's work required for effective teamwork. At the same time, you demonstrate\n    continuous progress by evolving your application one micro-increment at a time.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Typically,&nbsp;practices&nbsp;provide a set of activities to be performed. Each activity is captured as a set of\n    tasks, steps within tasks, and guidance. Even though micro-increments are not explicit constructs in the practices,\n    within the activities you will find descriptions of how to carry out a set of related micro-increments that are\n    commonly found in projects.&nbsp;This guidance does&nbsp;not provide a complete description of all potential\n    micro-increments:&nbsp;each organization should consider adding their own \"recipes\" for commonly occurring\n    micro-increments.\n</p>"

Several methods can be used to incite the Retrospective team to begin their collective\n    investigative work, such as posing the following three driving questions to the team:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        \"What worked well for us during the past iteration (or project, and so on)?\"\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        \"What did not work well for us during the past iteration (or project, and so on)?\"\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        \"What should we do differently, or what improvements should we undertake during our next iteration (or project, and\n        so on)\".\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The questions are expected to generate actions that will assist the team in prioritizing suggested improvements for the\n    project, to be implemented during the subsequent cycle. In addition to the aforementioned investigative questions, a\n    Retrospective should include steps that provide structure for the team's focus and resulting work.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An effectively facilitated Retrospective will create an environment that is conducive to various practices of\n    inspection and adaptation. The methods of inspection and adaptation are project control mechanisms that assume, and\n    respond to, the existence of complexity, unpredictability, and constant change. Practiced in the context of a\n    Retrospective, the methods of inspection and adaptation produce a feedback loop from which flexibility, responsiveness,\n    and reliability are realized.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The mere execution of Retrospectives is insufficient without an organizational commitment to a collaborative culture.\n    The success of Retrospectives is directly proportional to, and necessarily contingent on, an environment that engenders\n    highly motivated and performing teams (not the individual), nurtures open and frequent communication, and provides a\n    thriving sense of dedication to the team community. Retrospectives embody the spirit of team collaboration and\n    self-reflection by offering an environment in which teams are encouraged to provide feedback and identify lessons\n    learned. The compositional aspects of the team are crucial in supporting the highly collaborative nature of\n    Retrospectives, enabling the team to produce insight(s) into improving the processes of the project.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Participants and facilitator\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The participants that gather in the context of a Retrospective constitute more than a \"working group\". The participants\n    should be thought of as \"a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose,\n    performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.\" [<a\n    class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#KAT93\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">KAT93</a>]\n</p>\n<p>\n    The participants should consist of individuals representing cross-functional groups, having been involved in the\n    project period or project incident for which the Retrospective will be conducted. The size of the team is important,\n    for the rigorously participative environment of the Retrospective may be difficult to achieve with an overwhelmingly\n    large group (25+ individuals), and a set period of time in which to conduct the Retrospective. Conversely, a small set\n    of participants that is under-represented by the appropriate functional groups will limit the benefits and productivity\n    of team collaboration and self-organization. Although a Retrospective achieves productive results by actualizing team\n    responsibility and self-organization, and opposing traditional imposed authority, the work conducted in a Retrospective\n    (involving the members of cross-functional groups) demands the presence of a designated facilitator.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The individual that is designated to assume the role of facilitator, or Retrospective leader, should possess\n    fundamental skills of a facilitative management approach:\n</p>\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n    <p class=\"quote\">\n        \"A facilitator is an individual who enables groups and organizations to work more effectively; to collaborate and\n        achieve synergy. She or he is a \"content-neutral\" party who by not taking sides or expressing or advocating a point\n        of view during the meeting, can advocate for fair, open, and inclusive procedures to accomplish the group's work. A\n        facilitator can also be a learning or dialogue guide to assist a group in thinking deeply about its assumptions,\n        beliefs and values and about its systemic processes and context.\" [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n        href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#KAN07\"\n        guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">KAN07</a>]\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    The facilitator can be expected to allow the participants to exercise a sense of ownership in the operating mode of\n    thought, act to remove impediments to the team's effort to reach targeted goals, foster an environment of trust and\n    thriving collaboration, and support the team in a manner that allows the team to achieve its best thinking. Ultimately,\n    the facilitator focuses on managing the format of the Retrospective, while the participants hone their skills in\n    managing the Retrospective content and maintaining a high-performance, participatory group dynamic.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Establish norms and agreements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Begin the Project Retrospective by establishing the duration, goals, and expectations of the session. The following are\n    typical durations for various Retrospectives:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Iteration:</b> 2 to 4 hours\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Incident:</b> 15 to 45 minutes\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Project:</b> 1 to several days\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Select the facilitator of the Retrospective.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If the team is gathering to conduct the first Retrospective, the group will need to create the cultural norms that will\n    be used in the future Retrospectives. If the team is regrouping to conduct a Retrospective, the existing cultural norms\n    will be used. Norm Kerth's Prime Directive is an excellent and widely referenced guiding principle for each\n    Retrospective:\n</p>\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n    <p class=\"quote\">\n        <strong>Prime Directive</strong>: \"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone\n        did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available,\n        and the situation at hand.\" [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n        href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#KER01\"\n        guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">KER01</a>]\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Remind the team that the Prime Directive and cultural norms of the Retrospective are in place to establish an\n    environment in which the members can safely expose sensitive topics and manage meaningful, if provocative, dialogue.\n    The cultural norms guide the team by a \"social contract\" that clearly outlines the <i>team values and working\n    agreements</i> that have been established by the team. The social contract needs to include organizational value\n    statements that govern acceptable behavior and interactions, supplemented by inviolable principles that govern the\n    conduct and ethics of the team. The team must establish these rules of group engagement before the Retrospective\n    continues to the core of the group's intended gathering. Examples of working agreements include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Tardiness is not acceptable\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Mobile phones must be powered off during the session\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        All participants must be in attendance throughout the duration of the Retrospective or ask permission from the\n        group for early departure\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        All opinions are welcome\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The team must strive for healthy, high-quality interaction\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The team's working agreements (and&nbsp;the Prime Directive statement) should be displayed prominently in the\n    Retrospective session, so that they are clearly visible to all members of the team and, if required, easily accessible\n    so that the team can edit the content. After it is defined, future Retrospectives can begin with a review of these\n    working agreements.\n</p>\n<p>\n    After the team has established a safe environment in which to conduct the Retrospective, the facilitator of the\n    Retrospective should elicit participation from the group, thereby granting tacit permission to members who are hesitant\n    to participate immediately.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Collect and analyze data\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The team begins this step of the Retrospective with a review of the meaningful characteristics of the iteration,\n    release, incident, or project period. The focus of the team's work in this step includes:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Critical developments,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Notable discoveries\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Work completed\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Project metrics (velocity, number of defects, and so forth)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Review of project artifacts (requirements artifacts, project plans, and such)\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Encourage the team to capture all information (project data, opinions, and so on) by using various tools (white boards,\n    charts, timelines) that provide a visual representation, so that the team can identify relationships and emerging\n    patterns.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The team uses guiding questions to collect and analyze meaningful project data. You can use these examples of key\n    questions to elicit relevant information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Were the defined goals and objectives met? Did the release meet its functionality and quality goals? Did the\n        release meet performance and capacity goals?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Were risks reduced or eliminated? Can we identify new risks?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Were all planned work items addressed? What was the team's velocity relative to the plan?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Did the end users provide favorable feedback on what we built in this iteration?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Are changes to the project plan required?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        What portion of the current release will be used to establish the baseline? What portion will need to be reworked?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Have there been external changes, such as changes in the marketplace, in the user community, or in the\n        requirements?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Was the development process appropriate? How can it be fine-tuned for the specific needs of this project?\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The team has generated a list of candidate topics to focus on for its collective inquiry, or heightened analysis. The\n    team's methods of analysis need to facilitate a deepening understanding of the events characterizing the iteration,\n    incident, release, or Project Retrospective. The team will be evaluating these driving factors, which ultimately\n    documents a roadmap for the next cycle:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Success:</b> \"What worked well for us during the past iteration (or project or phase)?\"\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Failure:</b> \"What did not work well for us during the past iteration [or project or phase)?\"\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Opportunities for improvement:</b> \"What should we do differently, or what improvements should we undertake\n        during our next iteration (or project or phase)?\"\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    With increasing emphasis, the thread of team collaboration continues throughout the Retrospective, thereby fostering an\n    environment conducive to candid, unimpeded examination by the team: a rigorous style of examination that will be\n    required to unearth the details lurking in the interactions of the team, the conditions of the project, fortuitous\n    events, failures, risks, and examples of flourishing success.\n</p>\n<p>\n    After the team has collected and analyzed the key data in the Retrospective, the team will have evaluated key project\n    content.

                      "<h3>\n    What is prioritized?\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Prioritization should happen for work items, such as enhancement requests,&nbsp;requirements, defects, project tasks,\n    and so on. The work items list provides one place for prioritizing work. Prioritizing units of work that are too small\n    may lead to analysis-paralysis.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Who prioritizes?\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Prioritization is done by the extended team. Here are some examples on how different team members contribute to the\n    prioritization:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Analysts&nbsp;collaborate with stakeholders to establish the initial priorities for work items to implement, such\n        as features, use cases, and scenarios.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Architects&nbsp;collaborate with stakeholders and the development team to identify the architecturally significant\n        use cases and scenarios, and re-prioritize these so that the team understands what needs to be done to drive down\n        technical risk, and&nbsp;to make progress&nbsp;on&nbsp;evolving the product in a technically sensible fashion.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Developers&nbsp;and&nbsp;testers help define&nbsp;(but do not decide) the priorities of defects relative to\n        achieving iteration objectives.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Project managers facilitate (but do not decide), driving convergence on what the team should focus on when planning\n        a project, planning an iteration, and managing an iteration. They do this in order to ensure smooth execution, and\n        that the perspectives of all team members are properly heard. When the team cannot gain consensus in a reasonable\n        time, the project manager has final say on the priority of work items that are too small to warrant the attention\n        of the paying stakeholders.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        stakeholders&nbsp;that pay for the application have the final say on what capabilities to prioritize.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    When do you prioritize?\n</h3>\n<p>\n    When you&nbsp;enter a new work item in&nbsp;the Work Items List, give it an initial priority. Priorities are always\n    changing. The sections below describe what re-prioritization is done when you are planning a project, planning an\n    iteration,&nbsp;or managing an iteration.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Prioritizing when planning a project\n</h4>\n<p>\n    During project planning,&nbsp;prioritize the key features, use cases, and scenarios. Also, potentially assign them\n    to&nbsp;iterations as a part of laying out the project plan, by defining at a high level what should be done when.\n    These priorities will be revised later on as iterations are planned.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When starting a project where an existing application will be enhanced,&nbsp;a Work Items List may exist from past\n    projects and usage of the application. If this is the case,&nbsp;go through the Work Items List to survey and\n    re-prioritize existing work items, so&nbsp;that the team understands what to focus on.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Prioritizing when planning an iteration\n</h4>\n<p>\n    When planning what to deliver for an iteration,&nbsp;the team needs to balance what delivers immediate value to the\n    stakeholders with what risks need to be mitigated.The chosen balance should be reflected in the iteration objectives,\n    which then drive further prioritization and assignments of work items to the next iteration. This exercise should be\n    done by the entire team to reflect all of the key perspectives, such as technical (\"doing task A before task B saves\n    you time\"), managerial (\"we do not have anybody that knows that legacy application until next iteration\", or business\n    (\"this scenario is more important than that scenario\").\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Prioritizing when managing an iteration\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The recommendation is not to&nbsp;expand or change the scope of an iteration, because this will almost certainly lead\n    to scope creep, as well as potential confusion among the team on what to work on. As new features and enhancements are\n    requested, capture them in the Work Items List, but do not assign them to the current iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    During an iteration, you are developing and testing code. As you develop solution increments, you will find defects. In\n    most cases, you will directly fix trivial&nbsp;defects as you find them during development. Examples of such defects\n    are the many problems you find as you implement your code (for example, using a test-driven development approach or\n    doing your regular unit tests). In other cases, the defect should be captured as a work item. This allows it to be\n    prioritized, and potentially developed by somebody else or at a different time. If a defect needs to be addressed to\n    provide an iteration build of reasonable quality&nbsp;and that&nbsp;aligns with the&nbsp;iteration objectives,&nbsp;the\n    defect&nbsp;should be&nbsp;fixed&nbsp;during the current iteration. Note that this is not a creep or change of scope,\n    since it merely indicates that something needs to be fixed to deliver what&nbsp;the team&nbsp;already committed to.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    How do you prioritize?\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Prioritizing is the difficult balancing of frequently competing priorities. For more information on the art of\n    prioritizing, see for example [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#COH05\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">COH05</a>].\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The goal with iteration planning is to establish a few high-level objectives for what to accomplish during the\n    iteration, produce a sufficiently detailed plan outlining who needs to do what to accomplish those objectives, and\n    define how to assess that you accomplished what you set out to accomplish.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Iteration planning is ideally done with the entire team (including key stakeholders) in a meeting (typically lasting\n    one to a few hours), at the beginning of an iteration. This ensures that the entire team understands what needs to be\n    done, and they become committed to the success of the team. In some cases, it is preferred to have a smaller subset of\n    people (such as the Project Manager, an Architect, and an Analyst) to meet in advance to prepare the meeting with a\n    draft iteration plan.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Define high-level objectives\n</h3>\n<p>\n    A key aspect of an iteration is to focus the team on a short-term deliverable of measurable value. Document between one\n    and five high-level objectives to make sure that you do not lose focus on what to accomplish during the iteration.\n    Typically, the project plan should outline one or several objectives for each iteration, and those objectives are used\n    as a starting point. If you need to further detail or clarify the objectives as you plan your iteration, do so.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The objectives are usually based on the following factors:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Critical risks not yet mitigated:</strong> Iteration goals often include driving down the most critical\n        risks.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>The time allocated to the iteration:</strong> Iterations are fixed in duration, so the Project Manager must\n        ensure that the goals for the iteration are realistic relative to the time and the resources allocated to the\n        iteration.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>The highest priority features:</strong> Requirements are prioritized to ensure that the critical features\n        of the application will be developed and tested early on.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Produce an Iteration Plan\n</h3>\n<p>\n    There is an Iteration Plan per iteration that should outline who will implement which work item in how long a time.\n    Since iterations are time-boxed, you need to understand how big your \"box\" is by assessing how many hours of actual\n    work can be taken on (see <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation_A4EF42B3.html\"\n    guid=\"_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w\">Guideline: Agile Estimation</a>. Let's assume that you have six team members, and you\n    have 15 working days in your iteration, and you on average can do five actual hours of work per person and day. This\n    will give you 6x15x5h = 450 hours of actual work. Note that the average team member only performs between four and six\n    hours of actual project work per day, with the rest being consumed by e-mails, meetings, and other overhead activities\n    not directly related to the project.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The team should then revisit and update priorities for all of the high-priority items in the Work Items List, to make\n    sure that an important work item is not missed that would otherwise fall just below the list of what can be taken on in\n    this iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Pick the top-priority work item and see if it matches the objectives of the iteration. If it does, assess whether the\n    work item is too big to take on within an iteration. If it is too big, break it down into smaller work items. Once the\n    work item has been decomposed, the team determines whether to take on one or several child work items.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Example:</b> The team would like to take on the work item called <i>Develop Use Case A</i>, but it would take\n    roughly 300 hours to develop, so they feel that it is only necessary to do a subset of the use case to achieve their\n    iteration objectives, allowing them to take on other high-priority work items. They divide the work item into five\n    smaller work items representing different scenarios of use case A. The team decides to take on one out of the five\n    identified scenarios in this iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When a team has decided to take on a work item, it will assign the work to one or several team members. Ideally, this\n    is done by team members signing up to do the work, because this makes people motivated and committed to doing the job.\n    However, based on your team culture, you may instead have the project manager assign the work.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The next step is for team member(s) to assess how many actual hours or days it will take to do the work. Ideally, you\n    want to have each work assignment to be from a few hours up to&nbsp;two days of work. If the work item is too big,\n    consider breaking it down into smaller work items.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The team sums up the actual estimate for each work item they have committed to, and checks if they can commit to any\n    more work.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Example:</b> Jack signed up to develop the chosen scenario for use case A. He thinks that it would take 50 hours, so\n    he decided to develop the work into a set of tasks, and he asks other team members to help out with various subtasks:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Detail the requirements (Jack): five hours\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Design the scenario (Jack, Ann, and David): five hours\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Implement and test the dB changes (Ann): 12 hours\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Implement and test the server portion (David): 16 hours\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Implement and test the client portion (Jack): 12 hours\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Total: 50 hours\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    As work items are decomposed into smaller tasks, estimates can typically be improved. You also better come to\n    understand what is involved, and whether other team members may be better suited to take on a subset of the task.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The team now determines whether they are willing to take on another work item by comparing actual hours signed up for\n    to the actual hours available. In this case, the team has only signed up for 50 hours so far, and hence has another 400\n    hours available.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Define Evaluation Criteria\n</h3>\n<p>\n    It is critical that it is clear to all team members and other stakeholders how you will measure success at the end of\n    the iteration. Obvious success criteria should include that you can test the functionality implemented, and that no or\n    few defects are detected. Having too many defects makes it impossible to use the functionality, and it will prevent\n    meaningful feedback. Test objectives and test cases need to be clearly outlined.\n</p>\n<p>\n    There may be other success criteria, such as that you demo the capabilities to a certain set of stakeholders with\n    favorable review comments, or that you can successfully demonstrate or make available a tech preview at a conference.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Getting started&nbsp;\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Iterative development is based on the idea that a software system is built iteratively in a series of increments. Each\n    increment adds a subset of the final system's functionality, and the system grows to become more and more complete over\n    the course of the project's iterations.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Consider making all of your iterations have the same duration. This is important for two reasons: it establishes the\n    \"heart beat\" of the project, and it helps understand the project team's performance. This supports the creation of\n    successively more accurate estimates of remaining work. Attack the hardest problems on the first iterations, but do not\n    overload the first iteration too much. Make sure that you can show progress at the end of each iteration. Do not extend\n    an iteration in order to finish work, but also do not finish an iteration without any software to be demonstrated. If\n    needed, break the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces so that this balance can be achieved.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Plan an iteration in detail only when it is due to start. Each iteration starts with an iteration planning meeting with\n    the whole project team. In this meeting, the objectives of the iteration are defined in terms of work items, tasks are\n    identified for these work items, and team members sign up for tasks and provide their estimates. At the end of the\n    iteration planning meeting, the iteration plan is comprised of a set of work items, decomposed into tasks that\n    individual team members sign up for. The iteration can be started. Once an iteration is under way, it should be allowed\n    to proceed according to its plan, with as little external interruption as possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n    During the course of the iteration, team members provide frequent status of their tasks in focused meetings. The\n    frequency of these meetings is decided by team: it could be daily, a couple times a week, or weekly. Team members work\n    on the tasks they signed up for, following the appropriate priority. Allow detailed informal peer coordination to\n    happen, and mark completed work items in the iteration plan. The overall iteration status is hence readily available in\n    the iteration plan at all times. Any work items that have not been justifiably completed by the end of the iteration\n    are removed from the iteration and re-assigned to the next one (or just returned to the work items list).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Make all iterations follow the same pattern. This helps the team to focus on activities that are specific to the\n    beginning, middle, and end of an iteration. For example, some common activities performed during an iteration are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Iteration planning\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Iteration architecture work\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Continuous development of micro-increments\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Creation of stable weekly builds\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Bug fixing\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Iteration review and Retrospective\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    See <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/concepts/iteration_lifecycle_B16552E2.html\"\n    guid=\"_DI_tICNaEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA\">Iteration Lifecycle</a> for more information.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Common Pitfalls\n</h3>\n<p>\n    There are common pitfalls experienced when adopting an iterative approach, including the ones listed in the following\n    sections. Fore more information on challenges when transitioning from waterfall to an iterative development approach,\n    see <a class=\"elementlinkwithusertext\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#KRU00\"\n    guid=\"_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig\">[KRU00]</a>.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    What project managers should plan for\n</h4>\n<p>\n    One of the most difficult situations for project managers is to transition from a traditional development approach\n    (such as waterfall) to an iterative approach. There is more planning with iterative development than with waterfall:\n    one plan per iteration. At every iteration, there is negotiation with stakeholders, changes in scope, and re-planning.\n    Project managers need to avoid detailed planning upfront, and should work with their best estimates for the tasks at\n    hand in a given iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    However, this behavior should not result in unplanned and non-prioritized requirements creating scope-creep, nor\n    unnecessary rework happening on elements that are not broken. The iteration plan, with iteration objectives and planned\n    tasks, should be collaboratively created by the project manager, the team, and stakeholders in order to promote a\n    common understanding and buy-in into what is expected at the end of an iteration.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Which comes first: specifications or software?\n</h4>\n<p>\n    In a waterfall approach, progress is often measured by the completion of specifications. For example, if the design\n    specification is completed and signed-off, the team advances to the implementation based on the design specification.\n</p>\n<p>\n    With iterative development, artifacts evolve throughout the iterations, and every iteration should result in an\n    increment in the capabilities offered by the solution: in other words, implemented, tested software that is able to be\n    demonstrated (and potentially shipped) to customers. Software comes first. Planning is more important than the plans.\n    Designing and architecting an evolving solution is more important than capturing and polishing design and architecture\n    models. At the end of each iteration, perform an assessment to gauge the completion of requirements that have passed\n    test cases. Another way to make significant progress is by focusing on the harder problems (or risks) as early as\n    possible, thus making sure that you create and use a sound, executable architecture as the basis for the other\n    requirements.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Different iterations for the different disciplines\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A common problem found in organizations moving from a waterfall to an iterative process is that they use the iteration\n    concept only as an \"envelope\" for their engineering disciplines. For example, it is common to hear people in those\n    organizations talk about \"requirements iteration\" or \"test iteration\". A fundamental tenet of iterative development is\n    that it takes a holistic view of work items: each work item assigned to an iteration is completed in that iteration.\n    For example, a \"Login User\" work item would see all required tasks (such as design, code, and test) to complete that\n    work item. At the end of the iteration, the Login User behavior can be demonstrated as an integral part of the\n    executable system.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    No visible progress\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Some teams will have work items that are not completed during an iteration as expected, and will not report problems.\n    This creates a false impression that work items planned for the iteration are being closed, thus showing an inaccurate\n    iteration burndown.<br />\n    In order to avoid this, monitor active tasks closely, and address any slippage promptly. Use frequent, short status\n    meetings to gauge progress and detect issues. Create a \"no blame\" environment where everyone feels empowered by the\n    team and actively seeks advice and help from the team.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Adding work to an ongoing iteration\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Management or stakeholders may impose more work to be added to an on-going iteration. While this is sometimes\n    legitimate (for business reasons), there is a risk that this work just gets informally accepted by the team, without\n    passing through the Work Items List, where it gets prioritized with the remaining work.<br />\n    In order to minimize the impact of new work being added to an iteration, make sure to involve stakeholders in the\n    planning process, so that they understand the impact a new work item brings to the current iteration. Be prepared to\n    negotiate the removal of lower priority work from the iteration, in order to accommodate the new requested work.\n    Another approach is to convince stakeholders that in a few weeks the iteration will end (with demonstrable progress),\n    and that the new work item can be prioritized and assigned to the next iteration.\n</p>"

                      "<p>\n    <strong>1. Defining scope</strong><br />\n    <br />\n    Ideally you should be able to match your project to an existing process and tool configuration that has already been\n    applied successfully on similar projects.<br />\n    Thus the scope of your tailoring will be none or relatively small.<br />\n    <br />\n    Process tailoring is different from process instantiation. Process tailoring is about roles and procedures, whereas\n    process instantiation is about specific individuals and specific work products. Process instantiation is covered by\n    project management practices, and typically includes:<br />\n    a. Identifying which individuals perform which roles (may include identifying backup individuals)<br />\n    b. Identifying which individuals do which approvals<br />\n    c. Where each work product is stored.<br />\n    d. Creating project plans with work items that reflect the process.<br />\n    <br />\n    The following are some typical examples of project-specific process tailoring:<br />\n    a. Adding/removing work products and tasks<br />\n    b. Changing milestones, and what work products will be made available at each milestone, and their state of\n    completion<br />\n    c. Tool and/or format used for each work product<br />\n    d. Responsibilities for review and approval (a RACI table is often useful)<br />\n    e. Detailed procedures for reporting progress, performing measurements, managing requirements, managing change\n    requests, etc.<br />\n    <br />\n    Sometimes projects will combine process tailoring and process instantiation. For example, you can create a RACI table\n    that includes both individuals and roles, and create a table that says not only which work products will be produced,\n    but also where the specific instances will be stored.<br />\n    This blending is fine, the only drawback is that such information has to be updated for each project, and can't be used\n    unchanged.<br />\n    <br />\n    <strong>2. Deciding how the process will be documented</strong><br />\n    <br />\n    The rest of this guideline assumes you are starting with a published process documented using Rational Method\n    Composer.<br />\n    There are several options for tailoring such a process (listed here from simple to more specialized)<br />\n    <br />\n    1. Automated<br />\n    Tools can automate aspects of the process so that they do not have to be separately documented.<br />\n    For example, the process template in Rational Team Concert can be tailored to require approvals before a work product\n    is closed. Rational Requisite Pro can require specific attributes to be stored for specific requirements types. And so\n    on.<br />\n    <br />\n    2. Document-based<br />\n    You can create one or more documents that describe how your project process varies from the published process.<br />\n    The Development Case is such a document. Examples of information that may be captured in a development case are:<br />\n    - differences in how roles are applied<br />\n    - which artifacts are added or dropped<br />\n    - what level of review formality to apply at each milestone.<br />\n    Other typical process documents include:<br />\n    <br />\n    •Manual Styleguide<br />\n    •Project-specific Templates<br />\n    •Measurement Plan<br />\n    •Problem Resolution Plan<br />\n    •Product Acceptance Plan<br />\n    •Quality Assurance Plan<br />\n    •Risk Management Plan<br />\n    •Requirements Management Plan<br />\n    •Configuration Management Plan<br />\n    <br />\n    Word templates are provided for these documents. Note that these documents can also be implemented as a website or a\n    Wiki.<br />\n    <br />\n    3. Wiki-based<br />\n    You can post a process on an EPF Wiki server. You can then add comments and make changes specific to your project. You\n    can also attach documents created using the \"document-based\" approach.<br />\n    <br />\n    4. RMC Configuration<br />\n    You can use Rational Method Composer to change the configuration and republish it.<br />\n    You can select and deselect individual practices, or use the tailoring perspective to add/remove individual\n    elements.<br />\n    <br />\n    5. Method Authoring<br />\n    If you do need to do substantial tailoring, then you can author your own practices and plug-ins using a method\n    authoring tool, such as EPF Composer or Rational(R) Method Composer.<br />\n    Guidelines for this are outside the scope of this practice (this is considered to generally be an enterprise-scope\n    concern).\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>3. Developing Project-specific Content</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Ideally there is relatively little process content unique to the project.&nbsp; However, project specific information\n    needs to be captured, and your team may develop their own best practices over time.&nbsp; Depending on the scope, and\n    how you've decided to capture process content, this may be a minor step performed by one person, or may require several\n    tasks assigned to several individuals.<br />\n    <br />\n    <strong>4. Deciding which tools will be used to create and maintain work products<br />\n    </strong>Ideally you should be able to match your project to a tool configuration that has already been applied\n    successfully on similar projects, and just make minor tweaks specific to your project.<br />\n    <br />\n    If you do need to make tool-fit choices, please refer to Practice: Organizational Process Definition, which has\n    guidance on how to select, acquire,&nbsp;and configure tools for specific process needs.<br />\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <strong>5. Deploying the process<br />\n    </strong>If only minor changes to the process have been made, then a simple briefing with affected stakeholders is\n    generally sufficient.<br />\n    However, if significant changes have been made to the process, or if the team is unfamiliar with the process being\n    adopted, then we recommend having a workshop to familiarize the team.<br />\n    Having mentors on the team, or accessible to the team, that are familiar with new practices can also increase the\n    success of adopting the practices.<br />\n    If skills are an issue, then additional training may be required and should be scheduled.\n</p>"

However, it can be expensive to customize training courses. Generic process training, like an\r\n        introductory course to the Process or one or more practices, should be conducted prior to project startup, or in\r\n        the early days of the project. More specialized training in techniques, methods or technologies, is often conducted\r\n        \"just-in-time\".

In such cases, the above classification\n    scheme may be reduced&nbsp;to \"Required\" and \"Not Required\".&nbsp; In other cases, say when you are tailoring a process\n    for an organization and further tailoring for individual projects is expected, a more extensive classification scheme\n    as described in the above table becomes important.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <a id=\"Impact\" name=\"Impact\">Impact</a> of Classification\n</h3>\n<p>\n    All work products classified as <i>Must have</i> or <i>Should have</i> must have their review procedures, tools,\n    templates and configuration management practices defined.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    The specification of these procedures is optional for work products classified as <i>Could have</i>-these decisions\n    could be left to the developers or projects that decide to produce these work products.\n</p>\n<p>\n    All work products classified as <i>Won't have</i> must have their omission justified.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The major benefit of adopting this classification scheme is that it clearly denotes how the process has been\n    customized, and where there are options for negotiation and local decision making.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <a id=\"Examples\" name=\"Examples\">Examples of Usage</a>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    One way to think about the work product classification scheme is that it sets constraints on how the work products are\n    used.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For example, if you decide that the project could have an Analysis Model, then further customization could adjust these\n    values by deciding that the project will meet one of the following criteria:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        It will have an Analysis Model\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        It won't have an Analysis Model\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        It will stay in its current state (an Analysis Model is optional)\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The classification scheme can even be used dynamically-allowing the status of the work product to change depending upon\n    which phase the project is in.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The following table shows different ways of treating the Analysis Model. The <b>How to use</b> column defines how the\n    work product is used in each of the phases.\n</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <table\n    style=\"BORDER-BOTTOM: rgb(128,128,128) 1px solid;

It explains how\n    the lifecycle model, discipline workflows, work products usage, and associated roles are customized for the needs of\n    XYZ Project.\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"Section1\">\n    2. Lifecycle\n</h3>\n<p class=\"Section1\">\n    The XYZ Project modifies the standard lifecycle described in DAD-ABC as follows:\n</p>\n<div class=\"Section1\">\n    <ul type=\"square\">\n        <li>\n            Drop \"Elaboration\" phase and the \"Lifecycle architecture\" milestone, in order to follow a more evolutionary\n            architecture approach. However, weekly project status reporting will report progress on architecture risks.\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n    Thus the phases and milestones will be as follows:\n</p>\n<ul type=\"square\">\n    <li>\n        Inception phase\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none\">\n        <ul type=\"circle\">\n            <li>\n                stakeholder consensus achieved\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Construction phase:\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none\">\n        <ul type=\"circle\">\n            <li>\n                Sufficient functionality\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Transition phase\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none\">\n        <ul type=\"circle\">\n            <li>\n                Production ready\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    3. Practices\n</h3>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">\n    Project XYZ follows all the practices in DAD-ABC, with the exception of \"Staged Integration\". The project is small\n    enough that only a single integration stream is required, and no dedicated integrator role is required.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    4. Work Products\n</h3>\n<p>\n    With regards to work products, the XYZ project has some deviations from DAD-ABC as listed below:\n</p>\n<ul type=\"square\">\n    <li>\n        Formal-Internal reviews and approvals are made by the Product Manager role, as opposed to the external Project\n        Review Authority established by the <u><font color=\"#0000ff\">ABC Governance Process</font></u> (ABC-GOV).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Globalization Plan is waived: the XYZ product will be initially marketed in North America, and therefore a waiver\n        for translation is requested.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Software Architecture Document is not produced; instead, we generate automated reports from our visual modeling\n        tool.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Added new artifact for Storyboards, which are maintained in Rational Requirements Composer tool\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Rational Team Concert tool is used to capture User Stories description and related work. The User Stories in\n        Rational Team Concert are linked to the respective Storyboards in Rational Requirements Composer.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    5. Reports\n</h3>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">\n    In addition to standard metrics required by ABC-GOV, the Team Lead gathers Requirements Traceability Coverage metrics\n    and use Rational Insight tool to generate them, as there is a need to be aware of high level system requirements that\n    were allocated to and refined by the XYZ project team.\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">\n    The team lead takes snapshots of all metrics every 2 weeks as opposed to once a month, as indicated by ABC-GOV.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    6. Roles\n</h3>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">\n    Added Course Developer role to the team - as part of the project we need to produce training material.\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">\n    Team Lead on this project will be referred to as covering both the Project Manager and Architect roles.\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">\n    Note: The assignment of specific individuals to particular roles or job positions is documented in the <u><font\n    color=\"#0000ff\">XYZ Project Plan</font></u> (XYZ-PPLAN).\n</p>\n<h3>\n    7.

                      "<h3>\n    Install the Tool on the Server\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Identify what other software is required for the specific tool to work, and install this software. For example, a tool\n    may require a database management system (DBMS) be installed first.<br />\n    <br />\n    When you have installed the support software, you can install the tool on the server.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Customize the Tool (on the Server)\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Decide how to customize the tool so that it supports the Development Process in the best way.&nbsp; The following are\n    some brief examples of how you can customize tools:\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Modeling tools\n</h4>\n<p>\n    You can create a template model that defines the structure of models. The template model will be used when creating a\n    new model. You can create a file in which you define what stereotypes to use, and their icons. Then this file can be\n    installed on all users' computers, so that they use the same set of stereotypes.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Requirements and Change Management tools\n</h4>\n<p>\n    You can create a project template, in which you define the attribute types to use. You can start with provided\n    templates and customize according to your needs.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Configuration Management tools\n</h4>\n<p>\n    You can often configure actions in response to 'events' that make the tool behave in a certain way. For example, you\n    can customize the tool so that when a user checks-in an item, a script is automatically executed that does some\n    checking on the item.&nbsp; There may also be customizations that support distributed development, such as \"multi-site\"\n    support with duplicated repositories.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Document the customizations in your process.<br />\n    <br />\n    Integrate with Other Tools\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Integrate the tool with other tools to make it easier to use. An integration between tools is in most cases in the form\n    of an extension to one or several tools. An 'integration extension' to a tool typically:\n</p>\n<p>\n    Synchronize data between the different tools. It automates the creation and maintenance of related items in development\n    projects<br />\n    Automatically adds traceability between related items in different tools.<br />\n    Allow the user to add traceability between items in different tools.<br />\n    Allow the user to navigate between tools. For example, access an item in a test tool from a requirements management\n    tool.<br />\n    Allow the user to run certain functionality from one tool. For example, the possibility to create items in another\n    tool.<br />\n    Allow the user to version a tool's items in a configuration management tool. For example, the possibility to version\n    control requirements (from RequisitePro) using ClearCase.<br />\n    Most tools offer ready-to-use extensions to integrate tools with each other.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Describe how the tools are integrated with each other in the process.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Install and Customize Tools on Clients\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Install the tool on each client. The least that is needed to do when installing a tool on the client side, is to set up\n    the connection to the repository on the server.<br />\n    <br />\n    Customize the tool on the clients, just as you customized the tool on the server:<br />\n    <br />\n    In some cases you do not have to do anything with the client. For example, if the client is a web-interface it is\n    enough that the clients get the address to the application on the server. Some tools allow you to do all customization\n    on the server side. When the users access the repository on the server, they automatically get the correct\n    settings.<br />\n    In other cases you customize the tool on the client by installing software that customizes the tool, or installing\n    files with customization information.<br />\n    It may be necessary to install 'integration software' on the client. Place the 'integration software' on a server and\n    allow the users to download and install it on their computers.<br />\n    <br />\n    If it possible you should automate the tool installation, and the tool customization for the users. The benefit of\n    creating installation programs is that it allows you to set up the tools so that the clients get all the right\n    settings, extensions, and connections to the repository. You create installation (and customization) programs, and\n    place them on a server. Then the users download these programs and run them to install and customize the tool in their\n    computer.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Setting up workspaces\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Most project teams require workspaces for a variety of purposes including:\n</p>\n<p>\n    - development workspaces for individuals to do their work\n</p>\n<p>\n    - integration workspaces for individuals to share their work\n</p>\n<p>\n    - build workspaces for builds that have achieved a certain level of quality\n</p>\n<p>\n    Part of setting up the tool environment is to set up the needed workspaces and the policies for how they are used.\n</p>"

                      "<p>\n    Good software development teams are made up of a collection of people who collaborate effectively. How the project team\n    is staffed, by either adding or removing people, will greatly impact the team's productivity.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When staffing a development project, consider the following advice:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Include people who fit into the existing team culture. Good teams do not just appear magically one day, but instead\n        are grown and nurtured over time. Invite people onto the team who will add value and, furthermore, who will not be\n        disruptive. Similarly, you may need to invite someone to leave the team if they do not fit well with the existing\n        team and they do not seem to be able to change.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        People should want to be on the team. People are far more productive when they are working on a project that they\n        believe in and want to see succeed.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Build your team with \"generalizing specialists\". A generalizing specialist is someone with one or more technical\n        specialties who actively seeks to gain new skills in their existing specialties as well as in other areas,\n        including both technical and domain areas. Generalizing specialists add value to the team because they have\n        specialized skills that you need, while at the same time appreciate the full range of issues that a general\n        understanding of the software development process and the business domain offers.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Include stakeholders. stakeholders, including business stakeholders (such as end users) and technical stakeholders\n        (such as operations staff), can add significant value to your team. Instead of just interviewing them to gain\n        information from them, or asking them to review your work, why not include them as active participants on the team?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Include specialists for short-term, specialized work. Specialists can still add value on an agile development team,\n        particularly when they have specific skills and experience that existing team members do not have. It can often be\n        very effective to bring a specialist into the team for a short period of time to help with a specific task (such as\n        installation and setup of an application server, the development of an architectural spike, or simply taking part\n        in a review).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Assess available knowledge and skills. Give people opportunities to evolve their skills. At the beginning of a\n        project, the team may not have the full range of skills that it needs, or perhaps a few individuals may not have\n        the skills required to fulfill the roles they are filling. This is a very common risk taken by the majority of\n        project teams for the simple reasons that you often cannot find the perfect combination of people and, even if you\n        could, you still want to provide people with opportunities to grow as professionals. Determine skills improvement\n        objectives and set up a plan to achieve them. Perform an assessment at major project milestones to track progress\n        against objectives.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Remember Brook's Law. Adding people to a late project will only make it later [<a\n        href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#BRO95\"\n        guid=\"_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig\">BRO95</a>]. The corollary is that removing people from a late project may speed\n        things up [<a href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html\"\n        guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">AMB04</a>].\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Sometimes you will need to go against some of this advice due to environmental constraints. Perhaps only specialists\n    are available (although there is nothing stopping a specialist from becoming a generalizing specialist), perhaps there\n    are not as many opportunities for people to try new things as they would like, or perhaps the stakeholders are not\n    available to be active members of the team. The advice above is designed to lead to as high-performing a team as\n    possible, but even partial adherence to this guideline will improve the team.\n</p>"

It aims at\n    creating the right level of granularity for each purpose, so that the investment in planning is held to a minimum.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Begin by understanding the high-level features that the system is expected to possess. These are the system's main\n    themes or services, and they are typically described or listed in a vision document. They serve to set goals and\n    expectations, both internally and externally, and they guide and constrain the iteration planning.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The project plan is coarser-grained than iteration plans. As <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#LEF07\"\n    guid=\"_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig\">[LEF07]</a> notes, a system can be described with a list of 25-50 features, calibrated\n    to the relative complexity of that system. Iteration plans, on the other hand, are described in terms of individual\n    user stories, use cases and scenarios, or other work items that will be&nbsp;developed in each iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As early in the project as possible, ideally as part of the kick-off of a new project, hold a planning session (with\n    the whole team and the stakeholders of the system) during which the initial project plan is established.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Update the project plan as often as necessary to reflect changing business priorities and needs.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Iteration plans help to estimate and track individual iterations.

This is best avoided by involving them in the planning process, and by\n    demonstrating the value of empirical planning by making the process transparent and open (to the organization and the\n    project's stakeholders) so that they can easily follow the progress of the project.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It can be difficult to find the right level of granularity for the features of a given system.

Software development\r\n    project managers tend to want to plan the entire project, and then let the team work the plan, resisting changes to the\r\n    plan as it executes. The Release Planning practice emphasizes the need to plan the next iteration in detail, while\r\n    planning the whole project at a high level. This practice also encourages the project manager to feel comfortable with\r\n    re-planning as needed to ensure accuracy in delivery dates and costs based on events that impact the project.<br />\r\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\r\n    Why adopt this practice?\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    Release&nbsp;Planning improves the accuracy of project planning, the ability to predict resource usage, and the ability\r\n    to meet established delivery dates. In adopting this practice, the project team can better manage scarce resources and\r\n    focus on delivering scope with higher quality and value to the organization.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In some development approaches, project managers would plan the whole project at project initiation, and then execute\r\n    the plan, with little or no modifications to the original project plan unless there were significant scope changes or\r\n    risks that derailed the project. These approaches depend a lot on the project managers' personal knowledge of the\r\n    scope, and the resources available to deliver the scope. In many cases, these plans would become inaccurate and useless\r\n    after the first one or two phases. At that point, many project managers would simply manage the milestones and abandon\r\n    the detailed tasks.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Even seasoned project managers can benefit from Release Planning. As more and more software developers move to\r\n    iterative methods for delivering software, the need to perform just-in-time project planning is critical.\r\n    Planning&nbsp;for the next few weeks is always more accurate than planning&nbsp;for the next few months. The goal of\r\n    this practice is to balance the high-level and low-level planning such that detailed (low-level) planning occurs\r\n    just-in-time to support the successful delivery of the software products.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n</p>"

The content lead is responsible for making sure that bugs\n    and enhancement requests are triaged and assigned, and responsible for updating the project burndown (status) on a\n    weekly basis.<br />\n    <br />\n    We also have a content architect (Ricardo Balduino), who is responsible for the overall structure and integration of\n    content from all content areas.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The work is divided into the following content areas:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Project management: Chris Armstrong (lead), Jochen Krebs, Per Kroll\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Requirements: Chris Sibbald (lead), Paul Bramble, Ana Paula Valente Pereira, Leonardo Medeiros, Kurt Sand, Bruce\n        MacIsaac, Jim Ruehlin, Ricardo Balduino, and others.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Change management: Chris Sibbald (lead), Kurt Sand, and others.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Development: Brian Lyons (lead), Scott Ambler, Ricardo Balduino, and others.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Architecture: Mark Dickson (lead), Jim Ruehlin, Ana Pereira, Chris Doyle, and others.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Test: Brian Lyons (lead), Nate Oster, Jeff Smith, Dana Spears, and others.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        General: Steve Adolph (lead),\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Developer outreach: Per Kroll / Naveena Bereny (leads), Ricardo Balduino, Scott Ambler, Kurt Sand, and others.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    3 Project Practices and Measurements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The OpenUP component team will use OpenUP practices adapted to address the fact that we are doing content development\n    rather than coding. Key artifacts include: Project Plan (Word), Work Item List (Bugzilla + Excel), Iteration Plan\n    (Word), and Status Assessment (Word).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Progress is tracked using two primary measurements using a point system. It is estimated that 1 point represents 2h of\n    work:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Project backlog: The project backlog shows progress relative to overall work to be done within the project.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Iteration backlog: The iteration backlog shows progress relative to work intended for the current iteration.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    4&nbsp; Project Milestones and Objectives\n</h3>\n<p>\n    This section covers objectives for the entire EPF 1.0 project.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Governance process in place, including guidelines for how to work with CVS\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Tutorials available to help people adopt EPF composer\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Process tools matured and usable to produce a broad set of processes and method content.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Basic set of interfaces / APIs defined, stabilized, and delivered.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Deliver basic printing capability.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Mature content.

                      "<h3>\n    Overview\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Although the entire purpose of a project is to produce a product, the specific goals of the team will vary\n    substantially throughout the project. In the beginning, there usually is considerable latitude in the requirements for\n    the product. It may not be clear whether the project is feasible or even if it is likely to be profitable. At that\n    time, it is critical to bring an answer to these questions and of little to no value to start developing the product in\n    earnest.&nbsp;Toward the end of the project, the product itself is usually complete, and issues of quality, delivery,\n    and completeness then take center stage. At different points in time, tasks are undertaken in new ways and work\n    products will have new content.\n</p>\n<p>\n    To coordinate the team's efforts in a manner that takes these fundamental observations into account, the project\n    lifecycle should be divided into a sequence of phases. Each phase has a defined set of goals, a particular iteration\n    style, and customized&nbsp; <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/task_6C1FF051.html\"\n    guid=\"_x459ktnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA\">tasks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/work_product_826E4C22.html\"\n    guid=\"_H4JXwB_SEdq6CKKKq4D7YA\">work products</a> to address the unique needs of the project at that point. The project\n    lifecycle provides <em>stakeholders</em> with oversight, transparency, and steering mechanisms to control project\n    funding, scope, risk exposure, value provided, and other aspects of the process.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It helps to organize iterations into phases. Each phase ends with a milestone aimed at providing oversight by raising\n    and answering a set of questions that are typically critical to stakeholders:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n        href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/inception_phase_C4456871.html\"\n        guid=\"_0hmKgBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA\">Inception</a>. Do we agree on project scope and objectives and whether or not the\n        project should proceed?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n        href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/elaboration_phase_BE880435.html\"\n        guid=\"_2plxwBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA\">Elaboration</a>. Do we agree on the executable architecture to be used for\n        developing the application, and do we find that the value delivered so far and the remaining risk is acceptable?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n        href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/construction_phase_873B6559.html\"\n        guid=\"_48EKsBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA\">Construction</a>. Do we find that we have an application that is sufficiently close\n        to being released that we should switch the primary focus of the team to tuning, polishing, and ensuring successful\n        deployment?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n        href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/transition_phase_DD5986E5.html\"\n        guid=\"__ca5UBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA\">Transition</a>. Is the application ready to release?\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    If the answer is Yes to those questions at the phase review, the project continues. If the answer is No, the phase is\n    delayed (usually by adding an extra iteration) until a satisfactory answer is received, or the stakeholders may\n    determine that the project should be canceled.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Within each phase, you might have one or several iterations, where the iterations aim at producing the results required\n    to answer these questions. As an example, to answer the question for Elaboration, we typically need to implement and\n    test key aspects of the system so that we understand what architecture we need, what commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS)\n    components we may need, what key risks we face and how to address them, the effectiveness of the team, and so on. These\n    needs will steer how we prioritize what is to be done in an Elaboration iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    One of the objectives of the project lifecycle is to focus on two key stakeholder drivers: <b>risk reduction</b> and\n    <b>value creation</b>. As figure 1 shows, the&nbsp;four phases here described focus the team on risk reduction related\n    to the questions to be answered at the end of the phase, while tracking value creation.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img height=\"268\" alt=\"Risk goes down and value goes up as project progresses.\" src=\"practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/resources/project_lifecycle.jpg\"\n    width=\"500\" />&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Figure 1 - Risk reduction (red curve) and value creation (green curve) during the project lifecycle</strong>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n    <i>Risk</i> is a manifestation of the likelihood of unexpected things happening to the project, and risk stands in the\n    way of value creation. Risk is directly proportional to uncertainty in estimates, and stakeholders typically want to\n    know sooner rather than later what value the project can deliver in the stipulated time. In many cases, you reduce risk\n    when you create value by implementing and testing the most critical capabilities. However, there are situations where\n    risk reduction and immediate value creation are at odds with each other, requiring careful balancing of these competing\n    priorities to maximize stakeholder value.\n</p>"

A risk-value lifecycle&nbsp;provide stakeholders with\nvisibility on two main drivers: risks need to be driven down and value&nbsp;needs&nbsp;to be&nbsp;driven up.&nbsp;At the\nend of each phase in the lifecycle, there is a milestone that will help answer the questions and find the balance between\nrisks and value. See <a class=\"elementLink\"\nhref=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones_5678231E.html\"\nguid=\"_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg\">Phase Milestones</a>&nbsp;for more information on milestones and <a class=\"elementLink\"\nhref=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/project_lifecycle_203F87.html\"\nguid=\"_nSfVwCNYEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA\">Project Lifecycle</a>&nbsp;for more information on balancing risks and value.<br />\n<p>\n    Divide phases into iterations that deliver an increment of software that you can&nbsp;demonstrate and, potentially,\n    deliver.&nbsp;Each iteration in a phase will contain just enough of any activity required to meet the objectives of\n    that phase by the time you meet the milestone that concludes it. If the milestone can't be satisfied, consider adding\n    one more iteration to that phase until the expected risks&nbsp;for the phase are mitigated or the expected stakeholder\n    value is provided.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Plan the number of iterations in each phase according to the lifecycle pattern that is most appropriate to your\n    project. For example, when the problem domain is familiar, the risks are well-understood, and the project team is\n    experienced, you may need only one iteration in Inception and one in Elaboration phases, then&nbsp;you can have\n    multiple iterations in Construction&nbsp;(to develop the requirements and architecture) and a few iterations in\n    Transition to migrate the product to users.&nbsp;Another example is when the problem domain is new or unfamiliar or the\n    team is inexperienced. In such a case, you might need several iterations in Elaboration to refine requirements and\n    architecture as you implement them, then one iteration in&nbsp;Construction to deal with less critical requirements.\n    For more information on lifecycle patterns see&nbsp;[<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#DOD94\"\n    guid=\"_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig\">DOD94</a>] and [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#GIL88\"\n    guid=\"_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig\">GIL88</a>].&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    Phases are not identical in terms of schedule and effort.

                      "<h3>\n    Getting started&nbsp;\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Implementing an effective change management process requires agreement on the appropriate level of change control. Not\n    all projects require the same level of control.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For small, co-located teams, a relatively light-weight process such as the one described here is sufficient.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For larger teams, or teams working on safety- or business-critical applications where the cost of failure is very high,\n    there is a need for more formal change control.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This practice describes the simplest possible change management approach, one in which change management is an integral\n    part of project management. In this approach, any one may request a change to the system (or supporting artifacts) at\n    any time, either to correct an identified defect or to add an enhancement. Change requests can result from any and all\n    project activities, including managing requirements, development, testing, customer service, customer review, and\n    discussions in the team, and can apply to the tools and process used by the team as well as work products produced by\n    the team. The request for change is captured on the backlog of outstanding [Project Work]. During project planning, the\n    team reviews the backlog, prioritizes work, and decides which changes will be implemented next.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Begin by reviewing the <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.team_change_mgmt.base/tasks/request_change_A048C387.html\"\n    guid=\"_0mwzEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Request Change</a> task and associated guidance. Next, review the Iterative Development\n    practice to understand how requests for change are captured and managed on the <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html\"\n    guid=\"_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A\">Work Items List</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If more formal change control is required, you may define a new practice, or re-use existing commercially available\n    practices. To define your own practice, begin by defining which roles will review, assign, implement, verify, and close\n    change requests. An explicit change request artifact, which includes a definition of the various lifecycle states of a\n    change request, may be of value for status reporting. Finally, define the tasks and associated roles that transition\n    the change request between the lifecycle states defined previously.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Common pitfalls\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <b>Too much process.</b> Too much overhead in reviewing, approving, and verifying a change request may slow down the\n    team. Simple changes should be possible with minimum overhead.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Too little process.</b> If not properly managed, changes can lead to scope creep, cost growth, schedule slippage,\n    dashed expectations, and project cancellation.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Poorly integrated configuration management.</b> In order to understand the impact of changes and to plan for\n    verification, change requests must identify which versions of which artifacts were affected by the change. A common\n    problem with stand-alone change management practices and tools is a lack of traceability to the affected configuration\n    items.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Unfortunately, as mentioned previously, there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" solution for change management. One possible\n    compromise is to classify change requests in two categories:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Change requests that have high risk or cost associated with them, or those that impact stakeholder expectations,\n        undergo a more formal change process (including stakeholder review and approval).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Change requests that are relatively low risk, or those that do not impact stakeholder requirements, can undergo a\n        more light-weight change process.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    This approach is common on large projects, and the two categories are commonly referred to as Class 1 change requests\n    (which require a more formal change process involving stakeholders) and Class 2 change requests (which are under the\n    control of the development team).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Finally, the appropriate choice of tools will greatly reduce the overhead associated with change management and\n    traceability.\n</p>"

These meetings help check the&nbsp;heartbeat of the project. All team\n    members are required to attend. The meetings are held in the same place at the same time every work day and\n    should&nbsp;not last for more than 15 minutes. Usually, teams conduct the meetings with everyone standing up to keep\n    them short (thus some call them \"standup\" meetings). Anyone who is directly involved&nbsp;can also attend the meeting\n    as an observer, but care should be taken because too many people in the meeting may cause disruption or cause people to\n    be uncomfortable in sharing information. Typical daily meetings should have 10 people at most.\n</p>During the daily meeting, each team member updates peers with answers to the following three questions <a\nclass=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\nhref=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#SCH04\"\nguid=\"_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig\">[SCH04]</a>:\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        What did I do yesterday?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        What will I do today?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        What is impeding my work?\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n    These three questions have a specific purpose [<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#SUT06\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">SUT06</a>]:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        The first question tests the focus of the team.

Work selection is performed within given constraints, including the priorities set by\n        stakeholders, time (such as the length of the current work cycle, iteration or project increment), the budget, and\n        the skills of team members.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Individuals select their own work.</b> Someone will choose to do something because they are good at it and know\n        that they can do the work effectively, because they want to gain more experience at something and hope to improve\n        their skills by working with someone with such experience, or because they know that the work needs to be done and\n        that it's their turn to do so. Although an individual fulfills one or more roles on a project team, that doesn't\n        imply that the person is constrained to doing only specific types of work.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>The team determines how to perform the work.</b> At the beginning of a work cycle, the team holds an \"all hands\"\n        planning meeting where it determines the general strategy for doing the work and the tasks required for that. More\n        detailed planning, if required, will be done on a just-in-time&nbsp;basis by the individuals doing the work. Notice\n        that the team is still constrained by your organization's standards, technical infrastructure, regulations, and so\n        on.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Everyone commits to the work.</b> The team commits to accomplishing the work that it has agreed to do by the end\n        of the&nbsp;work cycle. Individuals also commit to doing the work that they say they will do in that cycle,\n        although as the&nbsp;time progresses, various tasks may be renegotiated as required.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>The team coordinates regularly.</b> To ensure that the work is accomplished, the team must coordinate its\n        efforts effectively. This is typically done through daily standup (scrum) meetings of the team and impromptu\n        discussions between individuals.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    This is a participatory approach to decision-making, where everyone has the opportunity to provide input and to listen\n    to the decision-making process. The goals are to make decisions at the right place within the organizational structure\n    and to empower teams by giving them both the responsibility and the authority to get the job done. Giving them control\n    over their work improves motivation among team members and, thereby, their productivity.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Project manager responsibilities\n</h3>\n<p>\n    There is still work for the project manager on self-organizing teams:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Provide leadership.</b> Team culture and project vision must be nurtured and must evolve throughout the project,\n        and direction must be provided to the team.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Mediate disagreements.</b> The manager must be prepared to step in and make a decision when other team members\n        are unable to reach a decision.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Ensure that team members increase their skill sets.</b> From time to time, the manager may need to motivate\n        individuals to take on new tasks that are outside of their comfort zones or to work with others to help those\n        people gain new skills.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Ensure that the team respects their limits.</b> Self-organizing teams have the authority to make decisions\n        within the scope of their responsibility, but that doesn't mean that they get to rethink everything that they feel\n        like changing. For example, the development team must still conform to the technical infrastructure and to the\n        business strategy of your organization; they probably do not have the authority to change these things even though\n        they may not fully agree with them. When an issue falls outside of their scope of responsibility, the team must\n        either accept it or collaborate with the people with the appropriate authority.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <b>Summarize the project plan.</b> External stakeholders, such as senior management or business representatives not\n        actively involved with the team, will want to know the current status of the project and the team's current plans.\n        The project manager may be required to summarize and communicate this information to those people.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    What \"self-organizing\" does not mean\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The concept of self-organizing teams often sounds like anarchy or non-management to traditional IT professionals, but\n    this is not true. Although self-organization relies on team members being responsible and mature, it is tempered by the\n    guiding hand of a good project manager. It is also tempered by organizational standards, infrastructure, and external\n    regulations. \"Self-organizing\" doesn't mean that you have complete freedom to do what you want.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Self-organization isn't necessarily a consensus-based approach either. Sometimes, individuals will disagree with a\n    decision but will choose to go along with the will of the team. Consensus decision-making isn't ruled out by this\n    approach. but it certainly isn't required.\n</p>"

It also includes\n    stakeholders with the required domain knowledge.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Fluidity</i> refers to the idea that the team composition will vary over time.&nbsp;For example, at the beginning of\n    the project, you may need someone with deep build experience to help organize the team's build strategy, but after this\n    work is finished, this person leaves the team.&nbsp;Whole teams work in&nbsp;a highly collaborative manner, adopting\n    the most effective communication techniques for their situations and striving to work together as closely as possible.\n    It is through collaboration that people make each other better.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The goal of the&nbsp;Whole Team&nbsp;practice is to ensure that:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Everyone has a sense of belonging on the team, of being in it together.</strong>&nbsp;There should be no\n        \"outsiders,\" no \"them\" but only \"us.\"&nbsp;When everyone is on the team,&nbsp;people&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;blaming\n        others. Instead, there is&nbsp;a sense of&nbsp;collective ownership.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>The team includes everyone required to build the system.</strong>&nbsp;Ideally, you want a self-contained\n        team that has the skills and knowledge to get the job done.&nbsp;Realistically, this is not&nbsp;always possible at\n        all points, and sometimes you will need to bring in outside experts for brief periods of time for specific\n        goals.&nbsp;For example, you might need someone with experience at setting up the database at the beginning of the\n        project or, in the middle of the project, someone with specific expertise in a certain aspect of the domain.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Everyone on the team contributes any way that they can.</strong>&nbsp;With a whole team approach there is a\n        move&nbsp;away from specialists who focus on a specific category of work, such as&nbsp;analysis or&nbsp;database\n        administration,&nbsp;towards generalizing specialists who may have that expertise&nbsp;but will also work outside\n        of their specialty to help&nbsp;address the current need.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>The team is self-organizing.</strong>&nbsp;The people best-suited to plan and organize the work are the\n        ones who do the work. This results in&nbsp;better estimates (particularly when people know that they'll be held to\n        those estimates), more realistic schedules, and increased acceptance of the plan by the team.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong><strong>The team maintains a sustainable pace.</strong></strong>&nbsp; Just as you don't sprint throughout\n        a marathon, you can't go for weeks or months at a time working unrealistic levels of overtime.&nbsp;Tired people\n        are not productive people.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Everyone works together closely.&nbsp;</strong>Not only is it safer, it is better to ask others for help\n        when you need it.&nbsp;Another&nbsp;strategy for improving collaboration within the team is to have daily standup\n        (scrum) meetings where you share your current status and explain any problems that you might have.&nbsp;Non-solo\n        development practices, such as pair programming and modeling with others, are also common in the Whole Team\n        approach.\n    </li>\n</ul>"

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <i>Whole Team</i> refers to the organization that delivers software for a project, and it includes any and all\n    contributors (both direct and indirect participants) to the delivery. It creates a collaborative environment in which\n    the \"whole\" team participates in setting direction, managing work efforts, and delivering the solution. Successful\n    software delivery ultimately depends on people. This dependence means that the way people work together is a critical\n    success factor.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Background\n</h4>\n<p>\n    In some approaches to software development, customers and development managers tell developers what they want, when\n    they want it, and how much it can cost. Assignments are handed out and deadlines set without discussion. This\n    environment creates resentment among developers, managers, and customers. Developers also are asked or even expected to\n    work whatever hours it takes to get the job done. In addition, barriers exist or are created between teams, causing\n    team members to blame each other or pass the problem onto someone else.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Definition\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Whole Team embraces the concept that to be successful in terms of quality, schedule, and scope, people must feel\n    empowered to accomplish the project goals. This empowerment also means that the ultimate customer of the software must\n    be an active and equal participant in the process. The Whole Team process focuses on the collaboration among all team\n    members and the joint decision-making process.

Giving the team the ability and responsibility to organize their work and\n    determine how to best meet their commitments motivates team members to do their best. This also helps them collaborate\n    to ensure that the right skills are applied to the appropriate tasks. Self-organization impacts many areas, including\n    how planning and commitments are made (by a team, not by individuals), how work is assigned (you sign up rather than\n    get assigned), and how team members view their roles in the project (team member first, job function second).\n</p>\n<p>\n    <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.whole_team.base/guidances/guidelines/self_organize_work_assignments_F47FC314.html\"\n    guid=\"_rmBEkJjsEduad8I_c-ogIA\">Self-organization</a>&nbsp;requires a few things to work:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Transparency and commitments are crucial to aid in team communication and to bring out the best in the team\n        members.

The assumption is that the\n        project manager is the coach. This requires that the project manager avoid a command-and-control style of\n        management in favor of a coaching style. This has been a key recommendation in management books for the last two\n        decades, but some project managers may still not be able to make that transition.\n    </li>\n</ul>"

                      "<h3>\n    Getting started&nbsp;\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The ultimate goal of continuous integration (CI) is to integrate and test the system on every change to minimize the\n    time between injecting a defect and correcting it. If the team is new to continuous integration, though, it is best to\n    start small and then incrementally add subpractices, as identified in the subsection that follows. For example, start\n    with a simple daily integration build and incrementally add tests and automated inspections (code coverage, and so\n    forth) to the build process, over time. As the team begins to adopt the sub-practices increase the build frequency. The\n    following subpractices provide guidance in adopting CI.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Developer practices\n</h4>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Make changes available frequently.</b> For CI to be effective, <a class=\"elementLink\"\n        href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/change_set_430BF233.html\"\n        guid=\"_1QU9MAIoEdyLh7vsrHZ4YA\">Change Set</a>s need to be small, complete, cohesive, and <em>available</em> for\n        integration. Keep change sets small so that they can be completed and tested in a relatively short time span.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Don't break the build.</b> Test your changes by using a private build before making your changes available.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Fix broken builds immediately.</b> When a problem is identified, fix it as soon as possible, while it is still\n        fresh in your mind. If the problem cannot be quickly resolved, back out (do not complete) the changes.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Integration practices\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A build is more than a compile (compilation). A build consists of compilation, testing, inspection, and deployment.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Provide feedback</b> as quickly as possible.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Automate the build process</b> so that it is fast and repeatable and so that issues are identified and conveyed\n        to the appropriate person for resolution as quickly as possible.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Automation\n</h4>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Commit your test scripts to the CM repository so they are controlled and available to the rest of the team.\n        Automated testing is highly recommended, both for developer tests and integration tests. Tests need to be\n        repeatable and fast.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Commit your build scripts to the CM repository so they are controlled and available to the rest of the team.\n        Automated builds are highly recommended, both for private builds and integration builds. Builds need to be\n        repeatable and fast.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Invest in a CI server.The goal of continuous integration is to integrate, build, and test the software in a clean\n        environment any time that there is a change to the implementation. Although a dedicated CI server is not essential,\n        it will greatly reduce the overhead required to integrate continuously and provide the required reporting.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Common pitfalls\n</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>A build process that doesn't identify problems.</b> A build is more that a simple compilation (or its dynamic\n        language variations). Sound testing and inspection practices, both developer testing and integration testing, must\n        be adopted also to ensure the right amount of coverage.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Integration builds that take too long to complete.</b> The build process must balance coverage with speed. You\n        don't have to run every system level acceptance test to meet the intent of CI. Staged builds will provide a useful\n        means to organize testing to get the balance coverage and speed.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Change sets that are too large.</b> Developers must develop the discipline and skills to organize their work\n        into small, cohesive change sets. This will simplify testing, debugging, and reporting. It will also ensure that\n        changes are made available frequently enough to meet the intention of continuous integration.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>Failure to commit defects to the CM repository.</b> Ensure adequate testing by developers before making change\n        sets available.\n    </li>\n</ul>"

                      "<h3>\n    Getting started&nbsp;\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Begin by making sure that the team and key stakeholders understand what software architecture is and the value of\n    capturing it in a separate artifact.

Review the <a\n    class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_arch.base/workproducts/architecture_notebook_9BB92433.html\"\n    guid=\"_0XAf0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Artifact: Architecture Notebook</a> and associated guidance. Agree on what you want to\n    document.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Next, review <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/arch_views_viewpoints_7A6CD31.html\"\n    guid=\"_kgtcoNc8Edyd7OybSySFxg\">Concept: Architectural Views and Viewpoints</a> and <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/arch_mechanism_2932DFB6.html\"\n    guid=\"_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA\">Concept: Architectural Mechanism</a>. Both are crucial to understanding how to define\n    and communicate the architecture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Now you can turn your attention to deciding, as a team, how and when the architectural tasks should be performed.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        If you are working on a new project and you are at the beginning of the lifecycle, review <a\n        class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n        href=\"./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_arch.base/tasks/envision_the_arch_FF123A81.html\"\n        guid=\"_0f-1oMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Task: Envision the Architecture</a>.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        If you are working on a project that is already underway, take time to document the decisions that have already\n        been made and continue to evolve the architecture as development proceeds.

This requires too much documentation and makes it difficult for team members to understand why the\n    architecture needs to work the way it does. Building the architecture is an activity that requires collaboration to be\n    successful.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Avoid creating significant and detailed architectural documentation for agile projects. Don't get caught up in defining\n    exactly what the structure of the Architecture Notebook should be. Focus on capturing the key decisions and the\n    rationale for these decisions. Refer to more detailed documentation where necessary, and don't duplicate material. Keep\n    the documentation clear and concise. Make sure that the people who use the architecture (the development team) are\n    comfortable with the format and content of the architecture. Is there more or different information that they would\n    like to see? Would they like to see less, instead?\n</p>\n<p>\n    Document important decisions. Team members may be close by and you may be in constant contact with them, but teams\n    change and software architects move on to other projects. Failure to document important decisions raises the risk of\n    failure later because future team members won't have the benefit of being involved in today's collaborative decisions.\n    Consider future team members as collaborators that you simply don't have the opportunity to speak to face-to-face.\n</p>"

It is derived primarily\n    from OpenUP 1.0 content, and it includes refinements to structure the content into a practice and clean up content to\n    remove redundancy and improve consistency.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The following specific changes were made:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Created plug-ins and content packages to support practice library structure -- separate base and assign practice\n        plug-ins, separate role definition plug-in, and so forth.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Implemented delayed role assignment. Placed Architect role in new role definition plug-in. Moved all role\n        assignments and assignments of tasks and work products to standard categories to new assign plug-in.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Implemented default navigation view approach. Mapped all elements to the navigation view building blocks so that\n        they are included in a view\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Removed term definitions for roles and work products, because their definitions are enough.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Changed name of <i>Task: Outline the Architecture</i> to <i>Task: Envision the Architecture</i>.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Changed the name of <i>Task: Refine the Architecture</i> to <i>Task: Evolve the Architecture</i>.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Identified guidance that can be shared between architectural tasks and practices and defined the appropriate\n        practice elements in the common architectural guidance package in a separate, common plug-in\n        (core.tech.common.base).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Reviewed and re-factored tasks. Moved task details to guidance, where it can be shared between architectural tasks\n        and practices.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Placed all content related to visual modeling in separate content package, both in the common plug-ins and in the\n        practice plug-ins.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Created new elements that are common to all practices: Custom category with a description of \"title page\" for the\n        practice, How to Adopt page, Release Info page, and so on.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Removed association with guidance from the architecture discipline. It is just a standard category. All guidance is\n        associated with roles, tasks, work products (or other guidance).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Cleaned up the content to reflect the latest authoring guidelines:\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none\">\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                Removed references to specific roles in all elements\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Removed references to specific method assets (for example, OpenUP) and specific lifecycles (such as RUP\n                phases) from the method element descriptions.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Replaced references to artifacts outside of the practice with references to the appropriate slots.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Eliminated redundancy among tasks, concepts, and guidance. In many cases, this led to the deletion of\n                several guidance pages and the addition of several common guidance pages.\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The following method elements were added:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Key concepts, so they can be shared:\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                Concept: Analysis Mechanism\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Concept: Architectural Goals\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Concept: Architectural Constraints\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Concept: Architecturally Significant Requirements\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Concept: Key Abstractions\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Concept: Architectural Views and Viewpoints\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Example: 4+1 Views of Software Architecture (just renaming and retyping of original Guideline: Architectural View)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Guideline: Representing Interfaces to External Systems (defined to share content between the Concept: Software\n        Architecture and the Task: Refine the Architecture)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Guideline: Using Visual Modeling (visual modeling was originally in an addendum to the Guideline: Abstract Away\n        Complexity)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Guideline: Modeling the Architecture (information on visual architectural models)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Practice elements (elements common to all practices):\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none\">\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                Roadmap: How to Adopt This Practice\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Custom Category: Evolutionary Architecture Practice\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Supporting Material: Evolutionary Architecture Practice Release Information\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The following are the method elements that were deleted:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Guideline: Architectural Mechanisms (content merged with existing Concept: Architectural Mechanism to eliminate\n        redundancy)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Guideline: Determining Architecturally Significant Requirements (content moved to new Concept: Architectural goals)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Guideline: Architectural View (replaced with new Example: 4+1 Views of Software Architecture)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Guideline: Outline the Architecture (content moved to more specific individual guidelines)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Guideline: Develop the Architecture (content moved to more specific individual guidelines<br />\n    </li>\n</ul>"

                      "<p>\n    Designing a system is about creating the internal structure and behavior of a system that's robust, extensible, and\n    high-quality. Good design improves quality and makes a system easier to maintain and extend, while a poor design can\n    significantly raise the cost of producing and maintaining the software.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Design is an abstraction of the code that presents the system from a perspective that makes it easier to address the\n    structure and behavior of the software. This can be done through viewing the code, but it's more difficult and less\n    effective to address structural and behavioral issues this way. Design can be visual models, simple sketches, text\n    descriptions, etc. The critical element of design is that it describes how different elements of the system interact to\n    fulfill the requirements.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The amount of design that's formally documented and maintained will vary depending on the criticality of the design and\n    how much of the design needs to be communicated to future team members. At a minimum, all architecturally significant\n    design elements should be documented and kept up-to-date with the implementation. These are critical aspects of the\n    system that are necessary for the understanding and maintenance of the software. Other important or complex structure\n    and behavior may be maintained as well. And some contracts may require that the entire design is thoroughly documented.\n</p>\n<p>\n    On many projects there will probably be aspects of the design that are only documented for the purpose of creating a\n    solution or walking through how certain behavior will be realized. It may not be worth the overhead of maintaining this\n    information as the design is transformed through refactoring and other influences. However, it may be useful to archive\n    the initial decisions, whiteboard images, or files so they can be referenced in the future if necessary. These can be\n    viewed as \"old meeting minutes\" that are stored for potential future reference. They may not reflect the current\n    design, but they may still provide useful insight.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Multiple Passes\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The design will be revisited many times throughout an iterative lifecycle and even within an iteration. Each time some\n    design activity is being performed, it will be performed in the context of a specific goal. The goal might be to\n    identify a notional set of participants in a collaboration that can be exercised to realize the behavior required (an\n    analysis pass). The goal might be in the identification of some coarse-grained elements that are required to act out\n    some scenario (an architectural pass). Then a pass might be done within one of those components to identify the\n    elements within that will collaborate together to perform the behavior required (a more detailed design pass).<br />\n    <br />\n    Design might be performed in a particular context such as database context, user-interface context, or perhaps the\n    context of how some existing library will be applied. In these cases the design steps will be performed just to make\n    and communicate decisions regarding that context\n</p>\n<p>\n    Avoid analysis paralysis. Avoid refining, extending, and improving the design beyond a minimal version that suffices to\n    cover the needs of the requirements within the architecture. Design should be done in small chunks, proven via\n    implementation, improved via refactoring, and integrated into the baseline to provide value to the stakeholders.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Design versus Architecture\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Design is a real thing, the construction of the system's structure and behavior. Architecture defines principles,\n    contexts, and constraints on the system's construction. Architecture is described in architecture artifacts, but it's\n    realized as design (visual or otherwise) and implementation.<br />\n    <br />\n    One way to look at architecture is that it helps to make the entire design more cohesive with itself by balancing the\n    needs of the entire system. Design tends to focus on one area at a time. Architecture helps assure the design is\n    consistent and appropriate to the goals of the system. For instance, there may be constraints placed on most of the\n    design to support the performance of one part of the system, such as improving access to a legacy system. Failure to\n    conform to those constraints in the design may cause the system to fail to meet the performance requirements of the\n    legacy system access. Conforming to the architecture assures that all the goals of the system are met by balancing\n    competing technical issues.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Quality of Design\n</h3>\n<h4>\n    You Aren't Going to Need It\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The YAGNI principle is a good general approach to design. While designs should be robust enough to modify, re-use, and\n    maintain, it should also be as simple as possible. One of the ways to keep it simple is to make few assumptions about\n    what the design's going to need in the future. Don't assume you'll need something until you know you need it, then do a\n    good job of adding it. Add what's needed for the current requirement or iteration. Refactor the design as necessary\n    when more functionality needs to be added or the design must be made more complex to deal with new circumstances.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Coupling and Cohesion\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Two of the most fundamental principles of design are coupling and cohesion. A good design contains elements that have\n    high cohesion and low coupling. High cohesion means that a single element, such as a class or subsystem, is composed of\n    parts that are closely related or work closely together to fulfill some purpose. Low coupling means that the elements\n    of a system have a minimum of dependencies on each other. A single element such as a subsystem should be easily\n    replaceable by another subsystem that provides similar behavior.<br />\n    <br />\n    For example, in a payroll system an Employee class would have high cohesion if it contained elements and functions such\n    as Name, Tax ID Number, and Monthly Salary. At first, it may seem as if the Calculate Paycheck functional would also be\n    cohesive. But when you consider that hourly employees must be paid overtime, sales people must have commission\n    calculated for them, etc, the function is less related to Employee and should probably be its own class or\n    subsystem.<br />\n    <br />\n    An example of low coupling would be if the Calculate Paycheck subsystem can be easily replaced by third party that may\n    be more robust and offer more features.<br />\n    <br />\n    Coupling and cohesion are so important to be aware of because they arise in so many design principles and design\n    strategies such as patterns.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Open-Closed Principle\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Elements in the design should be \"open\" for extension but \"closed\" for modification. The goal of this principle is to\n    create software than can be extended without changing code&nbsp;<a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#MEY97\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">[MEY97]</a>. This is because every change to software runs the risk of introducing bugs\n    into code that's already correct. It also allows functionality to be re-used without having to know the details of the\n    implementation, reducing the time it takes to create something new. Keeping this principle in mind helps make a design\n    more maintainable.<br />\n</p>&nbsp;"

                      "<h3>\n    Identification of elements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Identify the elements, based on the needs of the requirements. The identification of elements can stem from a static\n    perspective of walking through the requirements and identifying elements clearly called out, which is a form of domain\n    modeling. This can pull in other elements identified as being in the application domain or deemed necessary from\n    examining the requirements for the portion of the system being designed. This identification can also pull from key\n    abstractions identified while defining the architecture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The identification of elements should also apply a dynamic perspective by walking through scenarios of use of the\n    system (or subsystem) and identifying elements needed to support the behavior. That behavior might be a scenario of use\n    from an external user perspective or, while designing a subsystem, a responsibility assigned to the subsystem that has\n    complex algorithmic behavior. Consider applying the <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern_C4047897.html\"\n    guid=\"_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q\">Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a> to identify the elements necessary to support the\n    scenario, or apply other patterns identified in the architecture that specify the elements that will be used to support\n    specific aspects of the scenario.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you are designing a real-time system, include elements to represent events and signals that allow you to describe\n    the asynchronous triggers of behavior to which the system must respond. <b>Events</b> are specifications of interesting\n    occurrences in time and space that usually (if they are noteworthy) require some response from the system.\n    <b>Signals</b> represent asynchronous mechanisms used to communicate certain types of events within the system.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If there are existing elements from previous passes over the design or from selected frameworks or other reusable\n    elements, reuse them whenever possible. See <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/software_reuse_B6B04C26.html\"\n    guid=\"_vO2uoO0OEduUpsu85bVhiQ\">Guideline: Software Reuse</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n    After identifying the elements, give each one meaningful name. Each element should also have a description, so that the\n    team members who work together to refine the design and implement from the design will understand the role that each\n    element plays.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Based on this information, the identification of elements could be applied several times in designing just one part of\n    the system. Although there is no one correct strategy for multiple passes, they could be done at a coarse-grained level\n    and then a fine-grained level, or at an analysis (abstract) level and then a design level.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Behavior of elements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    To identify the behavior of the elements, go through scenarios and assign behavior to the appropriate collaborating\n    participants. If a particular use of the system or subsystem can have multiple possible outcomes or variant sequences,\n    cover enough scenarios to ensure that the design is robust enough to support the possibilities.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When assigning behavior to elements, consider applying the <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern_C4047897.html\"\n    guid=\"_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q\">Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a>&nbsp;or other patterns identified in the\n    architecture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Behavior can be represented as a simple statement of responsibility, or it can be a detailed operation specification.\n    Use the appropriate level of detail to communicate important design decisions while giving the freedom to make\n    appropriate implementation decisions as those tasks ensue.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Avoid too much identification of behavior solely from the perspective of domain modeling. Include only behavior that is\n    really needed -- behavior identified by going through required scenarios of system use.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Behavior must be understood as a responsibility of an element, as well as an interaction between two elements in the\n    context of some broader behavior of the system or subsystem. The latter part of this will lead the developer to\n    identify relationships that are necessary between the elements.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Design element relationships\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The relationships between the elements necessary for the behavior must be designed. This can simply be the\n    identification of the ability to traverse from one element to another or else a need to manage an association between\n    the elements. Relationships can be designed in more detail, as appropriate. This can include: optionality,\n    multiplicity, whether the relationship is a simple dependency or managed association, and so on. These decisions that\n    drive implementation details are best made at the design level, where it is easier to see how all of the pieces fit\n    together.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Avoid defining too many relationships based on relationships in the application domain. Include only relationships that\n    are needed based on the requirements. On the other hand, a combination of requirements knowledge and domain knowledge\n    can lead to some detailed decisions on the relationships, such as optionality and multiplicity.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Analysis classes and YAGNI\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Analysis classes are used to identify initial buckets where system functionality should go. They're the first pass at\n    understanding where system behavior will be realized in the design and implementation. For example, an entity class\n    might initially represent all of the behavior for an employee, such as storing personal information and calculating the\n    value of a paycheck. Few assumptions are made about how the final design will look at this point. Analysis classes are\n    about making sure required behavior is represented somewhere in the system, rather than about creating a perfect\n    design.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Analysis classes allow you to begin designing from abstractions, so that the details of the system depend on those\n    abstractions and not the other way around. In the Employee class, the notion of an employee should start with the idea\n    of someone who works for the company, who has responsibilities and receives benefits. It's easier to create a design\n    from this simple idea. The complexity of the design should emerge from the abstract ideas of what the design needs to\n    do. This will also help keep coupling low and cohesion high.\n</p>\n<p>\n    YAGNI (You Aren't Going to Need It) is an approach to design where the developer creates only enough implementation and\n    design to address the required functionality. No assumptions are made about re-use or possible future uses of the\n    software. Software is improved when the system requirements demand more functionality or robustness.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The first classes created from a YAGNI perspective are much like analysis classes. You don't know how complex it may be\n    to calculate a paycheck for your employee, so you assume that functionality is highly cohesive with the rest of what\n    the Employee class must do. As you understanding of the requirement develops, the analysis class evolves into a set of\n    collaborating classes and patterns that better support the behavior of the system. For example, payroll calculations\n    could be moved into a pattern that handles all of the different types of paycheck calculations (overtime, commissions,\n    and so forth), thereby increasing the internal cohesion of the class.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Use analysis classes to define an initial place to put system behavior, and add only enough behavior to satisfy the\n    YAGNI perspective. Analysis classes will evolve into concrete design classes as more behavior is added and as the\n    design is refactored.

                      "<h3>\n    Review the design\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Design is best accomplished collaboratively, because it is a problem-solving activity with a range of&nbsp;parts and\n    perspectives. There should be a constant level of review to ensure that the decisions make sense within the area being\n    designed and in the design of the system overall. There also might be occasions where some area of design is reviewed\n    by a set of interested or knowledgeable parties, such as the architect who will verify that the design conforms to an\n    architectural decision or a developer who will be expected to implement the design.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The design should be examined to ensure that it follows heuristics of quality design, such as loose coupling and high\n    cohesion. Responsibilities should be appropriately distributed to elements in ways that there are no elements with too\n    much responsibility and no elements that are left without any responsibilities. The design should be able to clearly\n    communicate the design decisions, yet not delve into concerns best dealt with during implementation of code.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Ensure that the design follows any project-specific guidelines and conforms to the architecture. Modifications to the\n    design to improve it (based on issues identified in reviewing it) should apply <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/refactoring_F3D63EBD.html\"\n    guid=\"_YNx2sJ05EdyQ3oTO93enUw\">Refactoring</a>&nbsp;to ensure that the design and any existing implementation of the\n    design continues to fulfill its responsibilities.\n</p>Revisit the relationships between elements to improve the coupling in the design. Remove redundant relationships, try\nto make relationships unidirectional, and so forth. See <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\nhref=\"./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html\"\nguid=\"__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA\">Guideline: Analyze the Design</a> for more information.\n<h3>\n    Refine the design\n</h3>\n<p>\n    After creating an implementation that includes a set of collaborating elements, with the behavior and relationships\n    robust enough to pass developer tests, the design can be improved and transformed into a more robust and maintainable\n    system.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The visibility of each operation should be selected to be as restrictive as possible. Based on walking through the\n    scenario, it should be clear which operations must be available to other elements in the design and which can be\n    considered behavior inside of the element that has the operation. Minimizing the number of public operations creates a\n    more maintainable and understandable design.\n</p>\n<p>\n    With respect to parameters, the return value, and a description of how it perform the behavior, operations can be\n    detailed at a lower level that drives the actual implementation, or that detail might be left to be handled when\n    writing the code.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Data attributes can be identified based on information needed to support behavior or based on additional requirements,\n    such as information to be presented to the user or transmitted to another system. Avoid indiscriminate domain analysis,\n    because there might be a great deal of data in the domain that is not needed to support the requirements. Data\n    attributes can simply be identified or they can be designed in detail, with attribute types, initial values, and\n    constraints. Decide on the visibility of the data attribute; operations to access and update the data can be added or\n    deferred until implementation.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Generalization and interfaces can be applied to simplify or otherwise improve the design. Ensure that the use of these\n    techniques actually improves the design, rather than bogging it down with complexity. For example, common behavior can\n    be factored into a parent class through generalization or out to a helper class through delegation. The latter solution\n    can be more understandable and maintainable, because generalization is an inflexible relationship (see the section that\n    follows on inheritance).\n</p>\n<p>\n    The refinement of any portion of the design could include another pass through the design process. You might find that\n    what was initially identified as a single behavior of an element warrants a detailed walkthrough of the collaborating\n    elements to realize that behavior.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When updating an existing design -- especially one that has had portions already implemented -- apply refactoring to\n    ensure that the improved design continues to perform as expected.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Organize elements\n</h4>\n<p>\n    In a design of any notable size, the elements must be organized into packages. Assign the elements to existing or new\n    packages, and ensure that the visibility relationships between the packages support the navigation required between the\n    elements. Decide whether each element should be visible to elements outside of the package.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When structuring the design into packages, consider <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/layering_F169CF07.html\"\n    guid=\"_0gpkAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Layering</a> and other patterns. Although all design work must conform to existing\n    architectural decisions, the allocation of elements to packages and possible updates to package visibility are of\n    significant architectural concern. The developer should collaborate with the architect to ensure that package-level\n    decisions are in accordance with the rest of the architecture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This guideline first talks about the identification and design of the elements and then about organizing the elements\n    into packages. However, this is not a strict order of events. There is nothing wrong with identifying a package\n    structure for the system and then populating that structure with identified elements, as long as the actual elements\n    identified are allowed to influence the resulting package structure. See the sections on identification and behavior of\n    elements in <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html\"\n    guid=\"__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA\">Guideline: Analyze the Design</a>.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Identify patterns\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Identifying <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html\"\n    guid=\"_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Pattern</a>s and seeking opportunities to leverage patterns are useful techniques. The\n    value of patterns here is that they provide a shortcut to a robust design. For instance, when there's an interface\n    realized by multiple classes, it's possible that an Abstract Factory pattern will be useful, because the pattern\n    encapsulates the logic of what class should be instantiated. The more experienced a developer is, the better the\n    developer is at identifying opportunities to take advantage of, or leverage, patterns.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The longer you use patterns, the easier it will be to identify opportunities to leverage them. At first, look for\n    places where you can clearly specify the need for some behavior. Perhaps there's a place where some function or\n    algorithm must be shared between many different classes. How can this behavior be shared over and over among\n    heterogeneous classes? Or perhaps a third-party library is replacing a block of custom code. Is there a way to make\n    this transition easier by creating an interface that can use either implementation? These are opportunities for finding\n    or possibly creating a pattern.\n</p>\n<p>\n    See also <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#GAM95\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">[GAM95]</a>&nbsp;and <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#SHA05\"\n    guid=\"_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg\">[SHA05]</a>\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Inheriting behavior versus inheriting interfaces\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Inheritance (or generalization) is often used as a shortcut during implementation to quickly re-use behavior (code).\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Caution:</b><br />\n    Work hard to remove behavior inheritance in design. It will almost always cost more effort than it saves.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Inheritance is a very rigid structure with strict rules. A class that inherits from another class is establishing an\n    <b>is-a</b> relationship. The inheriting class is a type of the parent class-- the child has the same relationships and\n    behaviors as the parent. In most hierarchies, it will be impossible to maintain this type of relationship. Exceptions\n    quickly creep in, and it's common to find child classes that remove or override behavior in the parent classes. This\n    increases maintenance costs and makes it difficult to understand what each class does.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It's also too tempting to instantiate parent classes, which makes the parent class both abstract and concrete. If a\n    class has children, it must be abstract enough to support the generalized behavior of the children. But if it's\n    instantiated, it must be concrete enough to provide specific behavior. It's rarely possible to fulfill both of these\n    competing imperatives at the same time, and the design suffers.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Use association and aggregation relationships instead of inheriting behavior. Patterns are a good tool to leverage in\n    breaking up inheritance hierarchies.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Inheriting interfaces is safe, because only the description and not the implementation of what needs to be done is\n    reused.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Avoiding inheriting behavior is an application of the Open-Closed Principle.

Patterns are essential to creating, managing, and\n    evolving designs. As the name implies, evolutionary design involves returning to the existing design over and over\n    again to refine, change, and improve previous thinking. It can be performed at the beginning of a development cycle\n    (before implementation), during a development cycle (while implementing code), after the cycle (when the developer\n    tests have&nbsp;successfully executed), or any combination of these. The team should determine where in the development\n    cycle the design will be performed. See <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/tasks/design_solution_A97CE9EA.html\"\n    guid=\"_0fshwMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Task: Design the Solution</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Understand <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/refactoring_1B63BA3B.html\"\n    guid=\"_Poc7IPDzEdqYgerqi84oCA\">refactoring</a> and the difference between code refactoring and design refactoring.\n    There is no exact boundary separating the two, but there are some clear areas where the developer will wear the \"design\n    hat\" when reworking the design into a better structure. These areas will usually involve identifying where design\n    patterns can replace or enhance the existing design, or areas of the design where patterns can be identified and\n    harvested for reuse.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Common pitfalls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Evolutionary design emerges from refactoring existing design. This improves the design without changing the behavior of\n    the system. Failing to perform developer or unit testing is a high risk activity, as you can not guarantee that:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        The original design works correctly\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The refactored design works correctly\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Therefore, you must perform rigorous <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/developer_testing_FEBDAED6.html\"\n    guid=\"_ADwlAJRtEdyrdaw_xGakyw\">developer testing</a> in order to verify the robustness of the design.

The waterfall implies it is not possible to re-enter previous\r\nphases to perform rework on any part of the project. The evolutionary design process realizes a solution by enhancing and\r\nchanging its structure and capabilities incrementally. This practice fits well within the framework of an incremental,\r\niterative or spiral development process, but can be used in any methodology."

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Using visual modeling techniques to design software can help break down complex problems into a series of smaller,\n    easier to manage tasks. Sharing pictures rather than written documents or source code also helps the understanding and\n    communication of difficult concepts. Adopting standard modeling notations such as the UML increases this capability by\n    helping to make diagrams precise and unambiguous.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The degree of formality used when producing and disseminating models should vary according to your needs. Small,\n    collaborative teams modeling around whiteboards and capturing the results on a sheet of paper or with digital cameras\n    can yield good results. This can also help the team focus on producing software with the help of models; rather than\n    becoming sidetracked into over-engineering both the models and the solution. Modeling tools provide additional value to\n    projects, especially for more complex systems. Their specifics of use are outside the scope of this guideline, however.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This guideline does not describe a formal sequential progression through prescriptive design steps. Whether some or all\n    of these techniques are needed, or how long is spent on them will vary depending on real-world issues such as the\n    complexity of the requirements; the experience of the designer; and the way the team works.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This guideline uses a simplified scenario (Login) to help keep the focus on understanding the techniques rather than\n    the specific requirements. In the real-world, it is doubtful that much time would be spent modeling a simple problem.\n    Here is the use case diagram, for reference;\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img height=\"142\" alt=\"User Login Use Case Model\" src=\"practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/user_login_ucm.jpg\" width=\"472\" />\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Identify elements\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Render the identified design elements as classes in a UML diagram.&nbsp; Apply appropriate stereotypes and optionally\n    render the class using an icon specific to the stereotype to characterize the intent of the class in the design.&nbsp;\n    Name and briefly describe the classes in a few sentences. Do not spend too much time working on associations, as these\n    will be developed through working on collaborations in the next step.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Classes can be drawn as a basic UML rectangle or with a specific symbol associated with a particular stereotype.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The resulting class diagram should be conceptually similar to this one:\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img height=\"228\" alt=\"Identify Elements - Initial Class Model\" src=\"practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/identify_elements_bce.jpg\"\n    width=\"290\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n    For this example, the <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern_C4047897.html\"\n    guid=\"_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q\">Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a> has been used to derive two classes (LoginUI and\n    LoginController). In addition, two design elements already identified in the architecture (SecuritySystemInterface and\n    User) have also been incorporated.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Determine how elements collaborate to realize the scenario\n</h3>\n<p>\n    When determining collaboration, two kinds of diagrams are useful.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        A dynamic object diagram, showing how the design elements collaborate to realize the requirements.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        A static class diagram, showing the classes involved in realizing the requirements.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Remember to also update any other impacted diagrams as appropriate, based on modifications or additions to the design.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Create a number of dynamic object diagrams that walk through how a set of objects collaborate to perform the behavior\n    of the scenarios.&nbsp; Even if just one scenario is being designed, this might take multiple diagrams to render it in\n    smaller, understandable chunks or from multiple contexts.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img style=\"WIDTH: 776px; HEIGHT: 355px\" height=\"355\" alt=\"User Login Sequence Diagram\"\n    src=\"practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/user_login_seq.jpg\" width=\"776\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n    The above sequence diagram shows the user credentials being passed through to the security system for authentication.\n    Steps in the use case scenario are transformed into messages between the participating objects. The messages in this\n    example are not yet fully formed (there are no parameters or return values), so they are prefixed with \"//\" to show\n    that more work is needed.&nbsp; A sequence diagram was used in this example, but a communication diagram could have\n    been used.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;useful to create one or more static class diagrams that show the classes in the design that support\n    the realization.&nbsp; These class diagrams are often called View of Participating Classes diagrams, they provide a\n    focused view on the overall design by only showing the classes, relationships, operations, and attributes relevant to\n    the collaboration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img height=\"469\" alt=\"Login VOPC\" src=\"practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/login_vopc.jpg\" width=\"448\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n    This diagram shows the operations and relationships that were identified by drawing the sequence diagram. The\n    relationships in this example&nbsp;have not been refined yet, so they are just shown as simple associations. Remember\n    to examine the diagram to verify that the design can support the behavior in the sequence diagram.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Working at this level of detail in the model during the early stages of design can be helpful. It keeps the diagrams\n    relatively simple and easy to understand. It makes them easier to draw in a workshop and easier to change during\n    discussion. It is often easier to add the detail once there is agreement on the fundamentals.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Refine design decisions\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Once the fundamentals of the design are relatively stable, you can begin to add detail to the design. Some of this can\n    be performed in code or in the model. If modeling is chosen, then refine attributes, responsibilities and\n    relationships.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Describe responsibilities\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Class responsibilities are either actions to be performed by an object or knowledge maintained and provided to other\n    objects. Each class will typically have several responsibilities; each responsibility will evolve into one or more\n    operations during design.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Responsibilities are derived from messages on interaction diagrams or from non-functional requirements that a class has\n    to support. Document a responsibility by giving it a name, and optionally a brief description (what it does).\n</p>\n<p>\n    These operations can be left as self-evident from their context, they can be given textual descriptions of the\n    algorithm required to perform the behavior, or they could spawn off another whole pass of this technique where a set of\n    classes that collaborate together to perform the internals of the operation are identified, etc.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Describe attributes and associations\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A class may have to store simple data information, like: string, integer, and the like. For such simple type of\n    information, attributes are defined for classes. For a more complex or \"behavioral\" attribute, consider creating an\n    extra class and establish an association to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n    To perform their responsibilities, classes may depend on other classes to supply needed behavior. These other classes\n    might be ones already identified in this design session, they might be existing classes pulled from the architecture,\n    or the need for new classes might be conceived. Associations in a class diagram can be used to represent inter-class\n    relationships.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img height=\"439\" alt=\"Login VOPC (Refined)\" src=\"practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/login_vopc_refined.jpg\" width=\"557\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n    This diagram shows a number of refinements. The LoginUI class has been replaced by LoginForm. The User class has been\n    renamed UserCredentials and is created by the LoginForm class rather than LoginController. It is then used as a\n    parameter for subsequent messages rather than passing the individual attributes. The SecuritySystemInterface class has\n    been refined into two elements, ISystemSecurity, which provides a simple façade for interaction with the rests of the\n    design; and SecuritySystemProxy, which handles interaction with the external security system.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Design internals\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The classes in the design are likely to need to be distributed amongst different packages and subsystems or components.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img height=\"304\" alt=\"User Login - Design Packages\" src=\"practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/dv_packaging.jpg\" width=\"571\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n    In this example, the LoginForm, LoginController and UserCredentials elements have been placed in a package called\n    LocalSecurity. The SecuritySystemProxy is a part of a subsystem called SecuritySystemAdapter which realizes the\n    ISecuritySystem interface. The SecuritySystemAdapter wraps the legacy SecuritySystem, expressed here as a component\n    offering a validateUser interface.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Each of these packaged elements can be distributed amongst the team for further development work.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Conclusion\n</h3>\n<p>\n    This guideline walked through the techniques in a concrete manner started with a scenario of a use case through to\n    distributing the classes identified into a set of packages. This example demonstrates a technique for designing\n    visually, but it should be considered as just one conceptual pass of design.&nbsp; One could as easily apply this\n    technique when defining the internals of how the SecuritySystemProxy class will collaborate with a set of classes to\n    validate the credentials.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When applying this guideline, work in small chunks and keep in mind the goal of delivering software to the users that\n    provides value. To deliver high-quality software requires consideration of how the pieces will work together to deliver\n    that value. But as soon as key decisions have been made and the decisions have been communicated to the appropriate\n    team members, the team should move on to implementing the source code to verify the design and deliver the value.\n</p>"

Removed \"Identify constraints on the system\"||Need to determine how to make this work with GS method's practices for these removed steps.|Some options:|- OpenUP could be doing something simpler than the GS Method approach that is ok to do as well (need to convince GBS)|- OpenUP could have a practice for doing these additional things that isn't part of the \"basic vision\", but can be added in by contributing steps|- OpenUP could go with a more basic practice for defining a vision, and not do these aspects|- The steps could be written as \"optional things to do if you don't have a separate practice\".||I like the first option best.||2. Removed \"Update the vision\" which occurs throughout the task.||3. Removed all the links to work items - we shoudn't assume it is there.||4. Removed hyperlinks to attached guidance. We need to make sure this convention is followed elsewhere.||5. Removed links to OpenUP-only guidance, such as \"principles for collaborative development\". Makes sense, but we need to make sure this convention is followed elsewhere.",

                      "<h3>\n    Getting started&nbsp;\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Creating a shared vision involves understanding and agreeing on the fundamental \"what\" and \"why\" of the product under\n    development. This ensures that stakeholders and the development team have a common understanding of the problem to be\n    solved, and understand the stakeholders' needs.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Begin by reviewing the reference material associated with this practice to better understand the intent of the\n    practice. Review the template for the <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html\"\n    guid=\"_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Vision</a> to understand the information that it captures. Tailor the template for the\n    specific needs of the project. Review the <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../practice.tech.shared_vision.base/tasks/develop_technical_vision_9D36CF2F.html\"\n    guid=\"_0fOAoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Develop Technical Vision</a> task to understand what needs to be performed to capture\n    and communicate the vision. Review the guidelines on requirements gathering techniques and requirements reviews\n    associated with the Develop Technical Vision task, and select the appropriate technique(s) for the project. Educate the\n    development team and relevant stakeholders on the purpose of this practice, and get buy-in on the techniques that will\n    be used to establish and maintain a shared vision.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This practice is related to many other useful practices. For example:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Requirements practices: the vision is one of the outcomes of stakeholder requests elicitation. It is also the\n        primary input for developing more fine-grained technical requirements. stakeholders and the development team use\n        the vision to provide the context and high-level objectives for the detailed technical requirements.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Architecture practices: the vision outlines the high-level objectives and constraints for the system that inform\n        architectural design decisions.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Project management practices: the vision defines the scope and constraints of the project that are the basis for\n        work prioritization and initial estimates of effort. The value delivered by the team at each milestone must align\n        with stakeholders' expectations, expressed by the project vision.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Common pitfalls\n</h3>\n<p>\n    <b>Rushing into a solution before the problem is understood.</b> The result is typically a system that fails to solve\n    stakeholder problems and satisfy stakeholder needs. Avoid design while capturing the vision. Focus on the \"what\" and\n    \"why\" of the product, rather than detailing the solution. Detailed technical requirements will be developed later, in\n    conjunction with architectural design and trade-off analysis.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Failure to gain agreement on the problem to be solved.</b> Make sure that you have identified all stakeholders,\n    captured their needs and wishes, and obtained agreement on the problem to be solved and associated constraints. Missing\n    a critical stakeholder can result in significant re-work later.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Failure to manage scope.</b> Rome was not built in a day (or in a single project). Make sure that you capture\n    stakeholder needs and features, and prioritize them to deliver as much value as early as possible. If the estimated\n    effort is too great to commit to for a single external release, divide and conquer. The product vision may span more\n    than one release of the product, providing a roadmap for future work, as well as work planned for the current project.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Getting Started&nbsp;\n</h3>\n<p>\n    If you have just installed the test driven development (TDD) practice, start by reviewing the <a\n    class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/developer_testing_FEBDAED6.html\"\n    guid=\"_ADwlAJRtEdyrdaw_xGakyw\">Concept: Developer Testing</a>. These will introduce you to the basics of what you need\n    to know about developer testing in the context of TDD. For more introductory information, read this <a\n    href=\"http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to TDD</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If your organization has never done developer testing before, start your adoption by educating the members of the team.\n    Use the resources below for educational and reference materials. Begin to track your performance immediately, because\n    that will give you quick feedback on how rapidly the team is adopting TDD, even if it is a very low form of adoption at\n    first.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Tools are critical for creating and managing unit tests. Educate the team on using new tools, and discover which\n    practices and features of the tools will work best in your environment.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Specify modest, attainable goals when adopting TDD. For instance, instead of insisting that every code change must have\n    a developer test starting now, it may be better to limit TDD practices to a single important implementation element.\n    This will allow the team to come up to speed on tools and learn new development habits while minimizing the impact on\n    the overall schedule. After the team has gained some comfort with the new way of doing things (usually a couple of\n    weeks or a single iteration), your refined method for TDD can be applied to all new or changed code. Continue\n    increasing the team's capabilities with TDD by introducing new tools, constraints, monitoring, or methods in modest,\n    attainable increments. This also allows the team to experience success with new techniques, which usually leads to a\n    team that embraces rather than resists change.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Like all process changes, adopting TDD requires that team members change behaviors and develop new habits, such as\n    writing code only when a test already exists to validate it. Developers will need the education provided by the links\n    on this page, and the methods described in this practice, to develop these new behaviors. They will also need to have\n    their new behaviors enforced by the team as a whole, and by management, until constantly writing tests while writing\n    code is a habit. TDD is no different from other areas of process adoption. The managing body (bosses or the team) need\n    to put as much effort into creating new behaviors as the individual developers do.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>TDD Adoption scenario</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Here is one possible scenario for adopting the TDD practice. You will want to add, change, or remove steps to design an\n    adoption roadmap more suitable to your environment. Hiring a consultant experienced in TDD will also speed your\n    adoption of the practice and help avoid common pitfalls.\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Educate the team on TDD. Use the presentations and articles referenced in this practice as a starting place. It\n        would also be helpful for developers to attend a class on developer testing and TDD.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Have the team review the material in this practice.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Extend this practice to reflect any important constraints or requirements in your organization. For instance,\n        indicate any extra information that may need to be described when checking in system or test code, link to any\n        materials that describe internal tools that your team is required to use, or create a guideline describing how each\n        test must be documented or structured to conform to corporate standards.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Identify and prepare to collect the information or metrics that will tell you how well you are adopting this\n        practice. Make sure that the metrics are easy to collect. Highly accurate metrics that are difficult to collect are\n        often abandoned, so provide no value. Coarser measurements that are easy to collect usually provide sufficient\n        information, and it is more likely that they will continue to be collected.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Identify the initial, modest goals for your TDD adoption, such as \"An average of 2 tests per method for\n        implementation element X\". The goal is to be successful at some incremental amount of adoption, not to adopt\n        everything in a single event. Make success a regular habit.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Select a critical system implementation element to start applying TDD on. Begin using new TDD tools and techniques\n        to develop and test the code.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Select a time frame to evaluate the adoption of new TDD techniques. It should be long enough to allow new habits to\n        start to develop, but short enough that changes can be made relatively quickly. This will generally be sometime\n        between a couple of weeks and a couple of months.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Begin to use TDD as described in the practice. Write tests before writing system code.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Evaluate your TDD adoption based on the objectives and metrics that you defined.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Make adjustments based on your evaluation. Eliminate tools or tool features that do not prove effective, and\n        increase practices that are efficient and improve quality.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Determine the next step in adoption. Early on, this will be to write tests for more and more implementation\n        elements until TDD is performed on all software for the system. Often, you will be able to achieve this after just\n        a few evaluation cycles.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Continue to examine how your developer testing can be improved. Address problem areas in regular project review\n        meetings. Monitor testing sites (such as the ones referenced on this page), and have individual team members read\n        new articles and books about developer testing. They can report back to the group to generate insight and\n        discussion about more improvements that can be incrementally applied to your TDD practice.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Continue to extend or modify this practice to reflect how your team is performing TDD, and what the next increment\n        of adoption should be for your team.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>\n    <br />\n    Common pitfalls\n</h4>\n<p>\n    TDD is a new way of thinking about testing. Failing to plan and manage how the team's behavior needs to change over\n    time increases the chance of failing at TDD. Keep the team focused on TDD, and watch for the team falling back into old\n    habits.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Individuals may opt for expedience and skip \"small\" or \"insignificant\" tests in an effort to meet deadlines. TDD's\n    payoff is later in the development cycle, when the team is working with a high-quality baseline rather than fixing a\n    mountain of bugs that have piled up. No change is too small to be tested.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Individuals may ignore implementation refactoring once the code runs successfully. Implementation refactoring keeps the\n    code maintainable and reduces code decay, a phenomenon where the average number of errors created by a code fix\n    increases over time. The team must refactor after the code runs successfully in order to maintain stable code that can\n    be maintained and improved over the long term.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    With Test Driven Development (TDD) you do detailed design in a just-in-time (JIT) manner via writing a single test\n    before writing just enough production code to fulfill that test. When you have new functionality to add to your system,\n    perform the following steps:\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Quickly add a developer test</strong>. You need just enough implementation code to fail.&nbsp; For example,\n        a new method about to be added to a class could be created that just throws a fatal exception.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Run your tests</strong>. You will typically run the complete test suite, although for sake of speed you may\n        decide to run only a subset. The goal is to ensure that the new test does in fact fail.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Update your production code</strong>. The goal is to add just enough functionality so that&nbsp;the code\n        passes the new test.&nbsp;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Run your test suite again</strong>. If the tests fail you need to update your functional code and retest.\n        Once the tests pass, start over.\n    </li>\n</ol><br />\n<p>\n    <img height=\"600\" alt=\"Test First Design Flow\" src=\"practice.tech.test_driven_development.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/test_first_design.jpg\" width=\"294\" />\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Why TDD?\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A significant advantage of TDD is that it enables you to take small steps when writing software, which is not only\n    safer it is also far more productive than writing code in large steps. For example, assume you add some new functional\n    code, compile, and test it. Chances are pretty good that your tests will be broken by defects that exist in the new\n    code. It is much easier to find, and then fix, those defects if you've written five new lines of code than fifty lines.\n    The implication is that the faster your compiler and regression test suite, the more attractive it is to proceed in\n    smaller and smaller steps.\n</p>\n<p>\n    There are other common testing strategies (listed here in order of effectiveness).\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Write several tests first</strong>. This is a variant of TDD where you write more than one test before\n        writing just enough production code to fulfill those tests. The advantage is that you don't need to build your\n        system as often, potentially saving time. It has the disadvantage that you will write more production code at once,\n        increasing the difficulty of finding the cause of new bugs.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Test after the fact</strong>. With this approach you write some production code then you write enough\n        testing code to validate it. This has the advantage that you're at least still validating the code but has the\n        disadvantage that you lose the design benefit inherent in writing the testing code first.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n    An underlying assumption of TFD is that a unit-testing framework is available. Agile software developers often use the\n    xUnit family of open source tools, such as <a href=\"http://www.junit.org/\"><strong><u><font\n    color=\"#0000ff\">JUnit</font></u></strong></a> or <a href=\"http://www.vbunit.org/\"><strong><u><font\n    color=\"#0000ff\">VBUnit</font></u></strong></a>, although commercial tools are also viable options.\n</p>"

                      "<p>\n    Test driven development (TDD) is the practice of writing developer tests and implementation code concurrently and at a\n    very fine level of granularity.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In test driven design, the developer first writes a small test to validate a small change, runs the test to ensure that\n    it fails (a sanity check), and then writes just enough implementation code to make that developer test run\n    successfully. This cycle is short and it rarely goes beyond 10 minutes. In each cycle, the tests come first. Once a\n    test is done, the developer goes on to the next test until there are no more tests to be written for the implementation\n    of the work item currently under development.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img alt=\"file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Administrator/Desktop/tdd_flow.jpg\" src=\"practice.tech.test_driven_development.base/guidances/practices/resources/tdd_flow.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n    The practice of test driven development changes how the developer thinks. Tests are not written as an afterthought.\n    Instead, developer tests are written as part of the everyday, every minute way of building software.\n</p>\n<p>\n    What are the advantages of test driven design?\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Assumptions in the design are analyzed before the implementation code is written. To write developer tests, an\n        examination must be made of the behavior of each piece of code to be written. Correct and incorrect behaviors must\n        be defined. In a way, writing the tests before the code can be considered a version of detailed design.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Code units designed for testability up front are cleaner and more loosely coupled.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Errors are found earlier. Errors or gaps in the requirements and design are identified before coding begins, when\n        it could be tempting to move ahead based on assumptions.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        A clearer collaboration strategy between the developer and others that might be responsible for the requirements,\n        architecture, and design is put in place. During the creation of the tests, there must be a meeting of the minds as\n        to what has been specified. After that, the implementation can carry on with confidence that there is a shared\n        vision of what the code should do.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        There are unambiguous criteria for completion of the code. When the tests conclude successfully, the code is\n        working as specified. Non-functional quality dimensions can be dealt with separately, but there is a clear moment\n        when the code behaves correctly.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The technique drives the developer to work in smaller increments with faster quality feedback. At any time, the\n        developer is just one test away from having error-free code.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        There is a separation of concerns and effort between getting code working and improving the quality of the code\n        that already runs correctly. Separating out these two areas of concern provides focus and time management support\n        to a developer. In one pass over the implementation, the developer makes it pass the tests as simply as possible,\n        and then in a subsequent pass, looks for areas to improve.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n    See <a class=\"elementLink\"\n    href=\"./../../../practice.tech.test_driven_development.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/using_tdd_in_context_2ADBB50B.html\"\n     guid=\"_vLvAUGjFEd2PJ-nlV-86WA\">Using TDD in context</a> for more information.\n</p>"

                          "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The key to successful iterative development is ensuring that the development team maximizes stakeholder value and\n    minimizes risk early in the lifecycle, while minimizing re-work later.&nbsp; This imposes some constraints on how we\n    develop the use-case model.\n</p>\n<p>\n    At one extreme is the classical waterfall approach, which attempts to&nbsp;detail all of the requirements prior to\n    design and implementation.&nbsp; This approach delays delivery of stakeholder value and risk reduction unnecessarily.\n</p>\n<p>\n    At the other extreme is&nbsp;beginning development prior to understanding what the system must do.&nbsp; This approach\n    results in significant, and costly, re-work later in the lifecycle.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A better approach is to detail only those requirements which will be the focus of development in the next iteration (or\n    two).&nbsp; Selection of these requirements is driven by value and risk, and thus requires as a minimum an abstract\n    understanding of the \"big-picture\".\n</p>\n<p>\n    The following discussion will outline the approach used to evolve the use-case model to achieve these goals.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <a id=\"How the Use-Case Model Evolves\" name=\"How the Use-Case Model Evolves\">How the Use-Case Model Evolves</a>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The recommended approach to evolving the use-case model takes a \"breadth before depth\" approach.&nbsp; In this\n    approach, one identifies the actors and use cases and outlines them quickly.&nbsp; Based on this knowledge, one can\n    then perform an initial assessment of risk and priorities and thus focus the effort of&nbsp;detailing&nbsp;the use\n    cases on the right areas.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Inception\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The purpose of inception is to understand the scope of the system.&nbsp; We need to understand the main purpose of the\n    system, what is within the scope of the system, and what is external to the system.&nbsp; We must strive to list all\n    the primary actors and use cases, however we don't have the luxury of being able to detail all of these requirements at\n    this time.&nbsp; Strive to&nbsp;identify by name&nbsp;~80% of the primary actors and use cases and provide a brief\n    description (one - three sentences) for each.\n</p>\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n    <h5>\n        Identify stakeholders\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n        Begin by listing all the external stakeholders for the system.&nbsp; These individuals will be the source of the\n        requirements.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n        Identify Actors\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n        Name and describe the primary actors.&nbsp; See <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n        href=\"./../../../practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.base/guidances/guidelines/identify_and_outline_actors_and_ucs_BB5516A9.html\"\n         guid=\"_eyL0wCu-EdqSxKAVa9kmvA\">Guideline: Identify and Outline Actors and Use Cases</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n        Identify Use Cases\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n        For each actor, ask \"what does this actor want to accomplish with the system\"?&nbsp; This will reveal the primary\n        use cases for the system.&nbsp; Name and describe each of these as you discover them.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n        Update the Use-Case Model\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n        Update the use case model to capture the actor and use case names and brief description.&nbsp; Capture the\n        relationship between the actors and use cases.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n        Outline the Basic Flows\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n        For those use cases that are considered high priority by the stakeholders, or high risk by the development team,\n        capture a step-by-step description of the Basic Flow.&nbsp; Don't worry about structuring the flow at this\n        point.&nbsp; Focus on capturing the dialogue between the actor and the system and the key requirements for the\n        system.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n        Identify Alternate Flows\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n        As you work through the Basic Flows, ask: \"What can go wrong?\"; \"What options are available at this point?\";\n        etc.&nbsp; These types of questions will reveal alternate flows.&nbsp; Capture these, giving each a name and brief\n        description.&nbsp; Fight the urge to detail these alternate flows at this time.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n        Refactor the Use Case Model\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n        Based on the Basic Flows you have identified, determine if there is common behavior that could be factored out into\n        &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; use cases.&nbsp; Refactor the Use Case model accordingly.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n        Prioritize Use Cases\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n        Given the abstract description you now have of the requirements, work with stakeholders to prioritize the use\n        cases.&nbsp; This will be the primary input to iteration planning.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>\n    Elaboration\n</h4>\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n    <p>\n        The purpose of elaboration is to demonstrate the feasibility of&nbsp;the solution prior to committing additional\n        resources.&nbsp; To be successful, one must demonstrate that stakeholder value can be delivered and that the risk\n        of continuing is acceptable.&nbsp; We must strive to detail and implement ~20% of the scenarios.&nbsp; These\n        scenarios must be selected to achieve good coverage of the architecture (for example, a vertical slice through the\n        architecture, touching as many&nbsp;components and interfaces as possible, is preferred to elaborating the GUI\n        only).\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n        Detail Basic Flow\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n        For those UC selected for the next iteration, spend the time to detail the basic flow now.&nbsp;

Depending upon the\n        complexity of the system, you might want to introduce packages to group the use cases in a logical manner to\n        simplify communications, iteration planning, and parallel development.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>\n    Construction\n</h4>\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n    <p>\n        The purpose of construction is to incrementally deliver functionality (and value).&nbsp; Working from the iteration\n        plan, continue detailing the remaining requirements.&nbsp; Shoot for completion of ~90 - ~95% of use cases by the\n        end of construction.\n    </p>\n    <h5>\n        Detail Basic Flows\n    </h5>\n    <p>\n        For those UC selected for the next iteration, spend the time to detail the basic flow now.&nbsp;

Some requirements will\n    not be covered at this point.&nbsp; But the requirements must clearly not stress the design.&nbsp; The remaining ~5% to\n    ~10% of use cases must be detailed and implemented in this phase.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <a id=\"Avoiding Functional Decomposition\" name=\"Avoiding Functional Decomposition\">Avoiding Functional\n    Decomposition</a>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    A common pitfall for those new to use-case models is to perform a&nbsp;functional decomposition of the system. This\n    results in many small \"use cases\", that on their own do not deliver the \"observable result of value\" to the\n    actor.&nbsp; To avoid this, watch for the following symptoms:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Small</strong> use cases, meaning that the description of the flow of events is only one or a few\n        sentences.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Many</strong> use cases, meaning that the number of use cases is some multiple of a hundred, rather than a\n        multiple of ten.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Use-case names that are constructions such as \"do this operation on this particular data\" or \"do this function with\n        this particular data\". For example, \"Enter Personal Identification Number in an ATM machine\" must not be modeled as\n        a separate use case for the ATM machine, because no one would use the system to do just this. A use case is a\n        complete flow of events that results in something of value to an actor.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    To avoid functional decomposition, make sure that the use-case model helps answer these kinds of questions:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        What is the context of the system?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Why are you building this system?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        What does the user want the system to do?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        How&nbsp;do the users benefit from the system?\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    <a id=\"Structuring the Use-Case Model\" name=\"Structuring the Use-Case Model\">Structuring the Use-Case Model</a>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    There are three main reasons for structuring the use-case model:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        To make the use cases easier to understand.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        To partition common behavior described within many use cases.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        To make the use-case model easier to maintain.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Structuring is not the first thing you do, however. There is no point in structuring the use cases until you know a bit\n    more about their behavior than a one-sentence description. Establishing a step-by-step outline of the flow of events\n    can assure your decisions are based on an accurate understanding of the behavior\n</p>\n<p>\n    There are several advanced modeling concepts available in the literature for&nbsp;structuring the use-case model,\n    however, following the principle of \"keep-it-simple\" only the most useful of these, namely the &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;\n    relationship is discussed in this process.&nbsp; This relationship permits one to factor out common behavior into a\n    separate use case that is \"include\" in other use cases.&nbsp; See <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/use_case_model_CD178AF9.html\"\n    guid=\"_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg\">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;details.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Another aspect of&nbsp;structuring the use-case model for easier understanding is grouping the use cases into packages.\n    The use-case model can be organized as a hierarchy of use-case packages. For more information on use-case packages, see\n    <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/use_case_model_CD178AF9.html\"\n    guid=\"_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg\">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    <a id=\"Use Cases Are Always Related to Actors\" name=\"Use Cases Are Always Related to Actors\">Relationship Between Use\n    Cases and Actors</a>\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Running each use case includes communication with one or more actors. A use-case instance is always started by an actor\n    asking the system to do something. This implies that every use case must have communicates-associations with actors.\n    The reason for this rule is to enforce that the system provides only the functionality that users need and nothing\n    else. Having use cases that no one requests is an indication that something is wrong in the use-case model or in the\n    requirements.\n</p>\n<p>\n    However, there are some exceptions to this rule:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        An&nbsp;\"included\" use case might not interact with an actor if the base use case does.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        A use case can be initiated according to a schedule (for example, once a week or once a day), which means that the\n        system clock is the initiator. The system clock is internal to the system; therefore, the use case is not initiated\n        by an actor but by an internal system event. If no other actor interaction occurs in the use case, it will not have\n        any associations to actors. However, for clarity, you can use \"time\" as an actor to show how the use case is\n        initiated in your use-case diagrams. <strong>CAUTION:</strong> if you have a lot of \"time\" actors in your model,\n        challenge them.&nbsp; Perhaps you missed a real actor, such as an administrator responsible for scheduling reports,\n        etc.\n    </li>\n</ul>"

                      "<h4>\n    Most efficient way to write use cases\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Because use cases model requirements, they are highly dynamic by nature. The more we examine a requirement, the more we\n    learn, and the more things change. To further complicate the issue, changes to one use case can lead to changes in\n    others. Therefore, we want a flexible, highly efficient method for writing use cases that eliminates unnecessary work\n    and rewriting.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An iterative, breadth-first approach, in which the use case is continuously evaluated before adding detail, is an\n    effective way to write use cases. This breadth-first approach involves two aspects: writing the set of use cases and\n    writing individual use cases.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Writing sets of use cases:</strong> Use cases exist in sets, and the relationships between the various use\n    cases and Actors&nbsp;are important. As you learn more about the Actors, you also learn more about the system's\n    boundaries and transactions. Likewise, as you learn more about the system's transactions, you learn more about its\n    Actors. Therefore, it is more efficient to write several use cases simultaneously than to write them sequentially. This\n    way, you can identify and understand the effects of the various use cases upon each other as you write them, rather\n    than as afterthoughts that require rewriting or elimination of previous work.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Writing individual use cases.</strong> Similarly, it makes sense to write each individual use case iteratively.\n    Starting with the main scenario, you can then identify various alternative and error flows that the use case might\n    follow, then evaluate, rearrange or eliminate them, and then add the details of the surviving scenarios.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Consider factors that can influence the format and level of detail for your use case description.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Detail the flow of events of the main scenario\n</h4>\n<p>\n    As a starting point, use the step-by-step description of the use-case main scenario. Then, gradually add details to\n    this scenario, describing <strong>what</strong> the use case does, <strong>not how</strong> to solve problems internal\n    to the system.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A flow of events description explores:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        How and when the use case starts\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        When the use case interacts with the Actors, and what data they exchange\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        When the use case uses data stored in the system or stores data in the system\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        How and when the use case ends\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    It does not describe:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        The GUI\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Technical details of hardware or software\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Design issues\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Identify alternate flows\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A use case consists of a number of scenarios, each representing specific instances of the use case that correspond to\n    specific inputs from the Actor or to specific conditions in the environment. Each scenario describes alternate ways\n    that the system provides a behavior, or it can describe failure or exception cases.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As you detail the main scenario, identify alternate flows by asking these questions:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Are there different options available, depending on input from the Actor? (for example, if the Actor enters an\n        invalid PIN number while accessing an ATM)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        What business rules can come into play? (For instance, the Actor requests more money from the ATM than is available\n        in her account)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        What could go wrong? (Such as no network connection available when required to perform a transaction)\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    It is best to develop these scenarios iteratively, as well. Begin by identifying them. Examine each possible scenario\n    to determine whether it is relevant, that it can actually happen, and that it is distinct from other scenarios.\n    Eliminate redundant or unnecessary scenarios, and then start elaborating on the more important ones.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Structure the use case\n</h4>\n<p>\n    It is useful to structure the use case according to scenarios. This helps both to simplify communication and\n    maintenance and to permit the use cases to be implemented iteratively.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In addition to structuring the use cases according to scenarios, it is often useful to structure the scenarios\n    themselves into sub-flows. This provides an additional level of granularity for planning work and tracking progress.\n    Unless a sub-flow involves only a minor part of the complete flow of events (which can be described in the body of the\n    text), it is recommended that you describe each sub-flow in a separate section to the Flow of Events section. Sub-flows\n    that need to be in a separate section include these examples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Sub-flows that occupy a large segment of a given flow of events.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Exceptional and alternate flows of events. This helps the use case's basic flow of events to stand out more\n        clearly.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Any sub-flow that can be executed at several intervals in the same flow of events.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Describe special requirements\n</h4>\n<p>\n    You must also capture any requirements that are related to the use case, but are not taken into consideration in the\n    flow of events of the use case. Such requirements are likely to be nonfunctional.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Typically, nonfunctional requirements that refer to a specific use case are captured in the special requirements\n    section of the use case.&nbsp;If there are nonfunctional requirements that apply to more than one use case, capture\n    these in the system-wide requirements specification.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Describe preconditions and postconditions\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A <strong>precondition</strong> on a use case explains the state that the system must be in for the use case to be able\n    to start. Be careful in describing the system state. Avoid describing the detail of other, incidental activities that\n    might already have taken place.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A <strong>postcondition</strong> on a use case lists possible states that the system can be in at the end of the use\n    case execution. The system must be in one of those states. A postcondition also states actions that the system performs\n    at the end of the use case, regardless of what occurred in the use case. Post-Conditions can be categorized as Minimal\n    Guarantees&nbsp;or Success Guarantees.&nbsp; A Minimal Guarantee represents a condition that will be true when the use\n    case ends, regardless of how it terminates.&nbsp; A Success Guarantee represents a condition that will be true when the\n    use case ends successfully, regardless of which path it took.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Neither preconditions nor postconditions need to be used to create a sequence of use cases. As a general rule, there\n    must never be a case where you have to first perform one use case and then another to have a meaningful flow of events.\n    If that is the case, correct the problem by reviewing the use cases.\n</p>"

Includes the actor's area of responsibility\n    and the goals that the actor will attempt to accomplish when using the system.

For each actor, human or not,\n    ask:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        What are the goals that the actor will attempt to accomplish with the system?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        What are the primary tasks that the actor wants the system to perform?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Will the actor create, store, change, remove, or read data in the system?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Will the actor need to inform the system about sudden external changes?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Does the actor need to be informed about certain occurrences, such as unavailability of a network resource,&nbsp;in\n        the system?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Will the actor perform a system startup or shutdown?\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Understanding how&nbsp;the target&nbsp;organization works and how this information system might be incorporated into\n    existing operations gives an idea of system's surroundings. That information can reveal other use case candidates.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Give a unique name and brief description that clearly describes the goals for each use case. If the candidate use case\n    does not have goals, ask yourself why it exists, and then either identify a goal or eliminate the use case.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Outlining Use Cases\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Without going into details, write a first draft of the flow of events of the use cases identified as being of high\n    priority. Initially, write a simple step-by-step description of the basic flow of the use case. The step-by-step\n    description is a simple ordered list of interactions between the actor and the system. For example, the description of\n    the basic flow of the Withdraw Cash use case of an automated teller machine (ATM) would be something like this:\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        The&nbsp;customer inserts a bank card.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system validates the card and prompts the person to enter a personal identification number (PIN).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The customer&nbsp;enters a PIN.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system validates the PIN and prompts the customer to select an action.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The customer selects Withdraw Cash.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system prompts the customer to choose which account.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The customer selects the checking account.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system prompts for an amount.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The customer enters the amount to withdraw.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system validates the amount (assuming sufficient funds), and then issues cash and receipt.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The customer takes the cash and receipt, and then retrieves the bank card.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The use case ends.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n    As you create this step-by-step description of the basic flow of events, you can discover alternative and exceptional\n    flows. For example, what happens if the customer enters an invalid PIN? Record the name and a brief description of each\n    alternate flow that you identified.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Representing relationships between actors and use cases\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The relationship between actors and use cases&nbsp;can be captured, or documented.&nbsp; There are several ways to do\n    this. If you are using a use-case model on the project, you can create use-case diagrams to show how&nbsp;actors and\n    use cases&nbsp;relate to each other.&nbsp; Refer to&nbsp;<a\n    href=\"./../../../practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.base/guidances/guidelines/use_case_model_4C64E97D.html\"\n    guid=\"_0VAUsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Guideline: Use-Case Model</a>&nbsp;for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you are not using a use-case model for the project, make sure that each use case identifies the associated primary\n    and secondary actors.\n</p>"

Unfortunately, usability requirements are often the\n    most poorly specified requirements. Consider this common requirement: The system shall be easy to use. This doesn't\n    help much, because it cannot be verified.\n</p>\n<p>\n    While capturing usability requirements, it is a good idea to identify issues and concerns first, and then refine these\n    into verifiable requirements later (see <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n    href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/writing_good_requirements_48248536.html\"\n    guid=\"_6jXzYNcKEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q\">Guideline: Writing Requirements Statements</a>). According to a traditional definition,\n    usability consists of five factors:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Ease of learning:</strong> A user with a specified level of experience must be able to learn how to use\n            the system in a specified amount of time.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Task efficiency:</strong> A user must be able to complete a specified task in a specified time (or\n            number of mouse clicks).\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Ease of remembering:</strong> A user must be able to remember how to accomplish specified tasks after\n            not using the system for a specified period of time.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Understandability:</strong> A user must be able to understand system prompts and messages and what the\n            system does.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Subjective satisfaction:</strong> A specified percentage of the user community must express\n            satisfaction with using the system.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    You might want to use the following method to identify and specify usability requirements:\n</p>\n<div style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 2em\">\n    <ol>\n        <li>\n            Identify the key usability issues by looking at critical tasks, user profiles, system goals, and previous\n            usability problems.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Choose the appropriate style to express the requirements:\n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                    <strong>Performance style:</strong> Specify how fast users can learn various tasks and how fast they\n                    can perform the tasks after training.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    <strong>Defect style:</strong> Rather than measuring task times, identify usability defects and\n                    specifies how frequently they can occur.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    <strong>Guideline style:</strong> Specify the general appearance and response time of the user\n                    interface by reference to an accepted and well-defined standard\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Write the actual requirements, including performance criteria (see <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\n            href=\"./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/writing_good_requirements_48248536.html\"\n            guid=\"_6jXzYNcKEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q\">Guideline: Writing Requirements Statements</a>&nbsp;for more information).\n        </li>\n    </ol>\n</div>\n<h3>\n    Reliability\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Reliability includes the system's ability to continue running under stress and adverse conditions. In the case of an\n    application, reliability relates to the amount of time that the software is available and running as opposed to time\n    unavailable. Specify reliability acceptance levels, as well as how they will be measured and evaluated. Describe\n    reliability criteria in measurable terms. This is usually expressed as the allowable time between failures or the total\n    allowable failure rate. Other important reliability considerations include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Accuracy:</strong> Specify requirements for the precision (resolution) and the accuracy (by some known\n            standard) that is required in any calculation performed or in system output.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Availability:</strong> Specify requirements for the percentage of time the system is available for use,\n            hours of use, maintenance access, and degraded-mode operations. Availability is typically specified in terms of\n            the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Recoverability:</strong> Specify requirements for recovery from failure. This is typically specified in\n            terms of the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR).\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Frequency and severity of failures:</strong> Specify the maximum defect rate (typically expressed as\n            defects/KSLOC or defects/function-point) and severity of failures. Severity&nbsp;can be categorized in terms of\n            <strong>minor</strong>, <strong>significant</strong>, and <strong>critical</strong> defects. The requirements\n            must define each of these terms unambiguously. For example, a <strong>critical</strong> defect could be defined\n            as one that results in loss of data or complete inability to use certain functionality of the system.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Performance\n</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Response times:</strong> Specify the amount of time available for the system to complete specified\n            tasks and transactions (average, maximum). Use units of measurement. <em>Examples:</em>\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                Any interface between a user and the system shall have a maximum response time of 2 seconds.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                The product shall download the new status parameters within 5 minutes of a change.<br />\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Throughput:</strong> Specify the capacity of the system to support a given flow of information (for\n        example, transactions per second).<br />\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Capacity:</strong> Specify on the volumes that the product must be able to deal with and the numbers of\n        data stored by the product. Make sure that the requirement description is quantified, and thus can be tested. Use\n        unit of measurement such as: the number of customers or transactions the system can accommodate, resource usage\n        (memory, disk, . . . ), or degradation modes (what is the acceptable mode of operation when the system has been\n        degraded in some manner) <em>Examples:</em>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                The product shall cater for 300 simultaneous users within the period from 9:00 AM to 11 AM.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Maximum loading at other periods will be 150.<br />\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Start-up:</strong> The time for the system to start up.<br />\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Shut-down:</strong> The time for the system to shut down.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Supportability\n</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Adaptability:</strong> Are there any special requirements regarding adaptation of the software\n            (including upgrading)? List requirements for the ease with which the system is adapted to new environments.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Are there any requirements regarding this system and its compatibility with\n            previous versions of this system or legacy systems that provide the same capability?\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Configurability:</strong> Will the product be configured after it has been deployed? In what way will\n            the system be configured?\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Installation:</strong> State any special requirements regarding system installation\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Level of Support:</strong> What is the level of support that the product requires? This is often performed\n        using a Help desk. If there are to be people who provide support for the product, is that support considered part\n        of what you are providing to the customer? Are there any requirements for that support? You might also build\n        support into the product itself, in which case this is the place to write those requirements. Consider the level of\n        support that you anticipate providing and what forms it might take.<br />\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Are there any special requirements regarding system maintenance? What are the\n        requirements for the intended release cycle for the product and the form that the release will take? Quantify the\n        time necessary to make specified changes to the product. There can also be special requirements for\n        maintainability, such as&nbsp;a requirement that&nbsp;the product must be able to be maintained by its end-users or\n        developers who are not your development team. This has an effect on the way that the product is developed, and\n        there can be additional requirements for documentation or training. Describe the type of maintenance and the amount\n        of effort required. <em>Examples:</em><br />\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none\">\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                A new weather station must be able to be added to the system overnight.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                The maintenance releases will be offered to end-users once a year.<br />\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Scalability:</strong> What volumes of users and data will the system support? This specifies the expected\n        increases in size that the product must be able to handle As businesses grow (or are expected to grow), the\n        software products must increase their capacities to cope with the new volumes. This can be expressed as a profile\n        over time.<br />\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Testability:</strong> Are there any special requirements regarding the testability of the system?\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Constraints (+)\n</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Design constraints:</strong> Are there any design decisions that have been mandated that the product\n            must adhered to?\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Third-party components:</strong> Specify any mandated legacy, COTS, or open-source components to be\n            used with the system.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Implementation languages:</strong> Specify requirements on the implementation languages to be used\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Platform support:</strong> Specify requirements on the platforms that the system will support\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Resource limits:</strong> Specify requirements on the use of system resources, such as memory and hard\n            disk space\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Physical Constraints:</strong> Specify requirements on the shape, size, and weight of the resulting\n            hardware to house the system\n        </p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Interface Requirements (+)\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Describe both the user interface and interfaces with external systems.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    User interface\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Describe requirements related to user interfaces that are to be implemented by the software. The intention of this\n    section is to state the requirements, but not to describe the user interface itself, because interface design can\n    overlap the requirements-gathering process. This is particularly true if you are using prototyping as part of your\n    requirements gathering process. As you develop prototypes, it is important to capture the requirements that relate to\n    the look and feel of the user interface. In other words, be sure that you understand your client's intentions for the\n    product's look and feel. Record these as requirements, rather than merely using a prototype for approval.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Look and feel:</strong> A description of the aesthetic appearance and layout of the interface. Your\n            client might have given you particular demands, such as style, colors, degree of interaction, and so on. This\n            section captures the requirements for the interface, rather than the design for the interface. The motivation\n            is to capture the expectations, the constraints, and the client's demands for the interface before designing\n            it. <em>Examples:</em>\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                The product shall have the same layout as the district maps from the engineering department.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                The product shall use the company color.<br />\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Layout and navigation requirements:</strong> Specify requirements on major screen areas and how they must\n        be grouped together.<br />\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Consistency:</strong> Consistency in the user interface enables users to predict what will happen. This\n        section states requirements on the use of mechanisms to be employed in the user interface. This applies both within\n        the system, and with other systems and can be applied at different levels: navigation controls, screen areas sizes\n        and shapes, placements for entering / presenting data, terminology<br />\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>User personalization and customization requirements:</strong> Requirements on content that must\n        automatically displayed to users or available based on user attributes. Sometimes users allowed to customize the\n        content displayed or to personalize displayed content.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Interfaces to external systems or devices\n</h4>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Software interfaces:</strong> Are there any external systems with which this system must interface? Are\n            there any constraints on the nature of the interface between this system and any external system, such as the\n            format of data passed between these systems?

The criteria for making this decision is that you don't see\n    disagreement among user kind of readers on what the use case means, and that designers and testers are comfortable with\n    the level of detail provided by the step-by-step format.

Consider the\n    use of a recycling machine. The customer inserts deposit items, such as cans, bottles, and crates, into the recycling\n    machine. When she has inserted all her deposit items, she presses a button, and a receipt is printed. She can then\n    exchange this receipt for money.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Is it one use case to insert a deposit item, and another use case to require the receipt? Or is it all one use case?\n    There are two actions, but one without the other is of little value to the customer. Rather, it is the complete dialog\n    with all the insertions, and getting the receipt, that is of value for the customer (and makes sense to her). Thus, the\n    complete dialog, from inserting the first deposit item, to pressing the button and getting the receipt, is a complete\n    case of use, a use case.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Additionally, you want to keep the two actions together, to be able to review them at the same time, modify them\n    together, test them together, write manuals for them and in general manage them as a unit. This becomes very obvious in\n    larger systems.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Getting Started\n</h3>\n<p>\n    After getting some basic familiarity with the concept of use cases, consider identifying use cases in a workshop\n    environment, led by someone experienced in writing use cases. Detail one or a few example scenarios to serve as an\n    example for other use case authors, to set a standard for format, style, and level of detail.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Some teams prefer to identify all of the use cases and actors first, capturing those in a UML use-case diagram, or\n    other sort of visual notation. Then they iteratively detail the use cases assigned to the current or next iteration, by\n    outlining the steps in the use case main flow and alternative flows. When these steps and flows are detailed in the\n    amount needed for development to start, it is useful to group flows in what is called use-case scenarios. Some teams\n    prefer to identify scenarios first and then write the use cases in a more structured way later, by grouping related\n    scenarios together. Scenarios can be used as a unit of work assignment and progress measurement on how use cases are\n    analyzed, designed, implemented, and tested throughout the project.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As you get more comfortable with this practice, consider supplementing your use cases with storyboards, activity\n    diagrams, and additional requirements techniques. Modeling use cases in UML diagrams or in modeling tools can be\n    helpful when there are lots of use cases, but start with a focus on the text and some key scenarios.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Common pitfalls\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Try to avoid applying functional decomposition approach to use cases. That can lead you to find too many use cases, and\n    use-case descriptions that are a half-page or less in length. On the other hand, finding too few use cases can result\n    in overloaded use cases. It can lead to long and complex use-case descriptions. Try to find a balance that makes sense\n    for your team, stakeholders, and the type of system that you are developing. There are different opinions about what is\n    the appropriate number of use cases for a system. The suggestion is that even large, complex systems will have no more\n    than a couple dozen use cases on average.\n</p>"

This is particularly important for larger projects, or families of systems\n    where the same use cases can be designed differently in different products within the product family.

In UML this is shown as a\n    dashed arrow, with an arrowhead like a generalization relationship, indicating that a realization is a kind of\n    inheritance, as well as a dependency.<br />\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img alt=\"Use Case Realizations\" src=\"practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/ucrea1.gif\" width=\"277\" height=\"109\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n    A use-case realization in the&nbsp;design can be traced to a use case in the use-case model.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Class Diagrams Owned by a Use-Case Realization\n</h4>\n<p>\n    For each use-case realization there can be one or more class diagrams depicting its participating classes.

There are two types of interaction diagrams: sequence diagrams and communication\n    diagrams. They express similar information, but show it in different ways. Sequence diagrams show the explicit sequence\n    of messages and are better when it is important to visualize the time ordering of messages, whereas communication\n    diagrams show the communication links between objects and are better for understanding all of the effects on a given\n    object and for algorithm design.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Realizing use cases through interaction diagrams helps to keep the design simple and cohesive. Assigning\n    responsibilities to classes on the basis of what the use-case scenario explicitly requires encourages the design to\n    contain the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Only the functionality actually used in support of a use case scenario,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Functionality that can be tested through an associated test case,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Functionality that is more easily traceable to requirements and changes,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Explicitly declared class dependencies that are easier to manage.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    These factors help improve the overall quality of the system.\n</p>"

However, it can be expensive to customize training courses. Generic process training, like an\r\n        introductory course to the Process or one or more practices, should be conducted prior to project startup, or in\r\n        the early days of the project. More specialized training in techniques, methods or technologies, is often conducted\r\n        \"just-in-time\". This means that the training is given shortly before the method or technique is to be applied in\r\n        the project, to ensure that new knowledge is fresh in mind. \"Boot-camps\".\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        1-5 weeks of concentrated hands-on training.

See <a class=\"elementLink\"\r\n    href=\"./../../core.mgmt.slot.base/guidances/guidelines/collaboration_guidance_slot_D3B8DD40.html\"\r\n    guid=\"_68JUYN8-Edyhmsbt0Xyl8A\">[Collaboration Guidance]</a> for more information.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Track the status of each work item by using visual indicators of state information (for example: defined, completed,\r\n    accepted) in a wall or automated tool. Since iterations are typically fixed in duration, another primary way to gauge\r\n    progress is to continuously monitor current status and also estimate how much work remains. Plot an iteration burndown\r\n    chart on a daily basis in order to visualize progress on a given iteration. This chart is plotted with the total\r\n    estimates for all the items that are not yet started and the estimated remaining effort for any item in progress. See\r\n    <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\r\n    href=\"./../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/reports/iteration_burndown_9C1C96F5.html\"\r\n    guid=\"_uAzgkDg3Edu4E8ZdmlYjtA\">Report: Iteration Burndown</a> for more information.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Take corrective actions to adjust the course of the iteration if the burndown chart shows that the work will not be\r\n    finished as planned.\r\n</p>"

                                  "<p>\r\n    A Release consists of integrated, compiled code that runs cleanly, independently, and in its entirety. This is an\r\n    important rule because in order to be released or even \"potentially shippable,\" a Release increment must be able to\r\n    stand on its own, otherwise it is not shippable. Releases&nbsp;can be created at either the program or team level.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    There are three potential uses for a Release:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n        <strong>It is not used outside of the program:</strong> It has been produced to minimize risks linked to technology\r\n        and a program's capability to integrate components and to produce a Build. This situation usually happens at the\r\n        beginning of a new product lifecycle.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        <strong>It is used by Beta Customers and the Program Manager:</strong> It allows End Users to test it in a Beta\r\n        test environment, which provides immediate feedback and reduces risks associated with user interface ergonomics.\r\n        Customer feedback will influence the Program Backlog for later consideration.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        <strong>It is deployed or shipped and used by End Users:</strong> This result provides immediate value to the End\r\n        Users.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n    In many organizations, a program Release typically is timeboxed to 2 to 3 months of development effort and 2 to 4 weeks\r\n    of hardening which results in a scheduled release approximately every 90 days. Releases for individual Development\r\n    Teams usually occur more often than those for programs, but there are no hard and fast rules regarding how often\r\n    releases should be scheduled. The only requirement is that working software should be delivered \"frequently\" by both\r\n    development teams and programs. Although the example timeframe described above is arbitrary, empirical evidence\r\n    suggests it is about right for most companies and fits nicely into quarterly planning cycles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Each Release has a set of release objectives and a projected delivery date; it also has a planned number of Sprint/Iterations.\r\n    For example, a brief description of a release might be: \"The goal of Release 2 is to provide B2B scheduling capability\r\n    for the Ordering and Logistics Department. The Release is targeted for June 31 and will consist of five 2-week Feature\r\n    Development Sprint/Iterations and&nbsp;one 2-week Release Sprint/Iteration.\"\r\n</p>"

For more information on\r\n    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\"\r\n    href=\"./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/testing_qualitative_rqmts_CAE80710.html\"\r\n    guid=\"_0aJ6cMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">Concept: Testing Qualitative Requirements</a>.\r\n</p>"

                          "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Run this activity as a way to perform goal-based planning and execution. Work is taken on by developers, and work\n    progress is tracked based on the goals achieved using the designed, developer-tested, and integrated source code.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Context of what is being developed\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A context can be specified when a requirement is assigned to be developed, thus specifying how broadly a requirement is\n    to be developed in an iteration. Development may focus on a layer (such as the user interface, business logic, or\n    database access), on a component, and so on.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Whether a context is specified or not, the developer's responsibility is to create a design and implementation for that\n    requirement.&nbsp;The developer&nbsp;also writes and runs developer tests against the implementation to make sure that\n    it works as designed, both as a unit and integrated into the code base.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Overview of workflow\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Typical changes require some effort in designing the solution before moving into implementation, even if it is only a\n    mental exercise that results in no long-term work product. The design for trivial changes to the existing\n    implementation (to, for example, support some requirement) might be self-evident in the context of the existing\n    architecture and design.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Once the organization of the technical solution is clear, define developer tests that will verify the implementation.\n    This test-driven approach ensures that design considerations have in fact taken place before the solution is coded. The\n    tests are run up front and, if they fail, clearly define the criteria to determine if the implementation works as\n    intended.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Failed tests lead to&nbsp;an implementation of the solution, upon completion of which you run the tests again. This\n    innermost loop of implementation and developer testing is repeated until the tests pass.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Passing the tests does not necessarily mean that the solution is a high-quality, appropriate solution. It is proper to\n    revisit the design at this point. That path loops back through the process, since any changes to the design could\n    affect the developer tests and implementation.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Once the tests pass and the design of the solution is appropriate, there is one more possible loopback. It is best to\n    keep the test-driven, evolutionary design inner loops as tight as possible. Come up with some small-scale design\n    solution for a part of the work item, define a test or two for the implementation of that one part of the solution,\n    pass that test, verify the quality, and then continue on in a test-first manner until that part of the design is\n    working. Then, in the outermost loop of the activity, go back to the work item and design another chunk to get closer\n    to completion.\n</p>"

If that person cannot resolve the\r\n    issue, the ticket is escalated to Tier 3 support personnel who have a deeper understanding of the application's\r\n    code and the technology support the system's architecture.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    To properly convey the necessary information to each support tier, the application's code base should be well commented\r\n    and logically organized.

Every discipline defines standard ways of\n    doing the work it categorizes. Such standard ways are expressed by so-called <b>reference workflows</b> described with\n    <a class=\"elementLink\" href=\"./../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html\" guid=\"_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA\">capability pattern</a>s, which define how the tasks categorized by the discipline work\n    together (in the most generic way). These reference workflows are often used for educating and teaching practitioners.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Like other workflows, a discipline's reference workflow is a semi-ordered sequence of activities, presented as either a\n    breakdown structure or an activity diagram performed to achieve a particular result. The \"semi-ordered\" nature of\n    discipline workflows emphasizes that the discipline workflows cannot present the real nuances of scheduling real work,\n    for they cannot depict the optionality of activities, or the iterative nature of real projects. Yet they still have\n    value as a way for us to understand the process, by breaking it into smaller areas of concern.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    A good way to understand OpenUP is to think of it as targeted to teams that have the following objectives:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Apply the minimally necessary process that brings value.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Avoid being overloaded with unproductive formal work products.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Use a process that can be tailored and extended for additional needs that may arise during the software development\n        lifecycle.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    In order to be applied to as many project environments as possible, OpenUP is a process that has the following\n    characteristics:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Minimal - only fundamental content is included\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Complete - it can be manifested as an entire process to build a system\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Extensible - it can be used as a foundation on which process content can be added or tailored as needed\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Minimal\n</h4>\n<p>\n    OpenUP is considered an agile, lightweight process that promotes software development best practices such as:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        iterative development\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        team collaboration\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        continuous integration and tests\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        frequent deliveries of working software\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        adaptation to changes, and so on.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Other factors also count when determining the size of process material, such as the number of method elements like\n    roles, tasks, artifacts and guidance.\n</p>\n<p>\n    OpenUP provides descriptions of responsibilities, skills and competencies of the fundamental roles in a team. See the\n    list of <a class=\"elementLink\" href=\"./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/customcategories/role_list_4C636D88.html\" guid=\"_WCIHZMRdEdyD76CYS6Ta7A\">Roles</a>&nbsp;for more details.\n</p>\n<p>\n    OpenUP provides the essential artifacts needed to capture and communicate decisions. Ultimately, the process is not\n    governed by artifact creation. For example, thinking about design is more important than documenting the design;\n    assessing and planning an iteration is about promoting team collaboration instead of creating plans that are written in\n    stone. In addition, for each artifact, OpenUP suggests informal representations or provides informal templates as\n    starting points for teams that do not need to create their own. The team decides what the most appropriate form to be\n    applied is. See the list of <a class=\"elementLink\" href=\"./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/customcategories/work_products_FB13601A.html\" guid=\"__O1Y8MRgEdyD76CYS6Ta7A\">Work Products</a>&nbsp;organized by domains.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Tasks in OpenUP are clear and focused on results. Text is usually short and objective, describing how individuals\n    should collaborate to achieve objectives. Steps are short descriptions of what to achieve, and point to external\n    guidance on how to do it. See the list of&nbsp;<a class=\"elementLink\" href=\"./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/customcategories/tasks_E310E5A5.html\" guid=\"_CXQicMRhEdyD76CYS6Ta7A\">Tasks</a>&nbsp;organized by disciplines.\n</p>\n<p>\n    OpenUP recommends the least amount of process guidance a team should use in order to be successful. Teams may have\n    different names or responsibilities for roles, may perform tasks in or have different representations for artifacts,\n    but they still want to follow the principles and practices described in OpenUP to increase the chances of project\n    success.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Complete\n</h4>\n<p>\n    OpenUP is considered a complete process because it covers the essential disciplines in a software development lifecycle\n    by guiding the team in the following high level activities:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Customer needs and requirements are elicited and captured, with continuous customer involvement.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        A robust architecture for the system is evolved, addressing technical risks and promoting team organization.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        For each requirement, a technical solution is designed, implemented and tested, which conforms to the architectural\n        decisions.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The system is evaluated by tests that validate customer requirements.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Defects and enhancements feed back into development.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Work is prioritized, iterations are planned and assessed, and team members take on work to be done.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    However, OpenUP assumes that the project team is not responsible for certain activities and decisions that are assigned\n    to other areas of the organization, such as:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Creation of the business case is dealt with by management who decides whether or not the project is worth investing\n        in, what is the return on investment, and so on.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Environment setup - some organizational issues may not be in the scope of the team, such as: installation,\n        configuration and licensing of development tools and configuration management tools; development process\n        customization and publishing, etc.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Deployment and operation - addressed at an organizational rather than a team level.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Other areas of concern are also not present in OpenUP, because small teams do not need to deal with the formality or\n    overhead of these areas. They include, but are not limited to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Advanced configuration management\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Advanced requirements management\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Program and portfolio management\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Extensible\n</h4>\n<p>\n    OpenUP can be adopted by projects as it is, out-of-the-box, because it's minimal and complete.\n</p>\n<p>\n    However, different projects may have different needs. Organizations may be interested in customizing some aspects of\n    OpenUP to adapt it to their projects. These are some examples of possible customization:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Add new or rename existing roles\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Add steps to existing tasks\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Create new guidelines on a given technique\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Remove a given content area\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Modify existing or add new templates to artifacts\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Modify or create a new process lifecycle\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Add or remove process content\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Add guidance on how to achieve compliance\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Add guidance specific to a technology being used\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Replace or augment&nbsp;one of the layers with new&nbsp;content (e.g. by changing&nbsp;or adding material to how\n        management is performed)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Etc.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    OpenUP can be customized and extended by using the EPF Composer tool, which allows you to author, configure and publish\n    methods. With EPF Composer, you can add, remove and change elements according to your team needs, then publish the\n    content to serve as guidance for your team.\n</p>\n<p>\n    See more information about customization in <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\" href=\"./../../../core.default.tool_def.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/resources_for_customizing_methods_7663A1A6.html\" guid=\"_omneEMX4EduywMSzPTUUwA\">Supporting Material: Resources for Customizing Methods</a>.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Overview of OpenUP\n</h3>\n<p>\n    OpenUP is for small teams who work together in the same location. The team needs to engage in plenty of daily\n    face-to-face interaction. Team members include the stakeholders, developers, architects, project manager, and testers.\n    They make their own decisions about what they need to work on, what the priorities are, and how best to address\n    stakeholder needs. The organization must support the team by allowing them these responsibilities.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Team members collaborate extensively. The presence of stakeholders as team members is critical to successfully\n    implementing OpenUP.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Team members participate in daily stand-up meetings to communicate status and issues. Problems are addressed outside of\n    the daily meetings.\n</p>\n<p>\n    OpenUP focuses on significantly&nbsp;reducing risk early in the lifecycle. This requires regular risk review meetings\n    and rigorous implementation of mitigation strategies.\n</p>\n<p>\n    All work is listed, tracked, and assigned through the Work Items List. Team members use this single repository for all\n    tasks that need to be recorded and tracked. This includes all change requests, bugs, and stakeholder requests.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Use cases are used to elicit and describe requirements; therefore, team members need to develop skills in writing good\n    use cases. stakeholders are responsible for reviewing and certifying that the requirements are correct. Use cases are\n    developed collaboratively.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Architecturally significant requirements must be identified and stabilized in the Elaboration phase so that a robust\n    architecture can be created as the core of the system. An architecturally significant requirement change that must be\n    addressed may arise later in development, but the risk of this happening is significantly reduced in the Elaboration\n    iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Testing is performed multiple times per iteration, every time the solution is incremented with the development of a\n    requirement, change, or bug fix. These tests happen after developers have developed the solution (which should have\n    been unit-tested) and integrate it into the code base. These tests help guarantee that a stable build is created and\n    always available as development progresses.\n</p>\n<p>\n    OpenUP does not include content for deployment, configuration management, or the development environment (such as\n    customizing this process or setting up development environments). OpenUP focuses on a single team, and these areas are\n    generally addressed at an organizational or enterprise level. Look for extensions to OpenUP that address these wider\n    areas.\n</p>\n<p>\n    OpenUP is an iterative software development process that is minimal, complete, and extensible.

Each phase consists of one or more iterations where stable, working versions of the software are developed\n    and released, with the completion of each iteration representing a minor <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\" href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones_5678231E.html\" guid=\"_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg\">milestone</a>&nbsp;for the project and contributing to the successful achievement of the\n    phase's major milestone, where phase objectives are met.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The following diagram depicts&nbsp;<a class=\"elementLink\" href=\"./../../../process.openup.base/deliveryprocesses/openup_lifecycle_EE511F3A.html\" guid=\"_SuWj4dOPEdyqlogshP8l4g\">OpenUP Lifecycle</a>.\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img height=\"192\" alt=\"Figure 1: Diagram of the OpenUP Lifecycle\" src=\"publish.openup.base/guidances/roadmaps/resources/openup_lifecycle.jpg\" width=\"667\"     usemap=\"#map\" border=\"0\" />\n</p>\n<h4>\n    How&nbsp;to get started?\n</h4>\n<p>\n    The fourth OpenUP core principle, \"Evolve to continuously obtain feedback and improve\", suggests an iterative and\n    incremental approach to adopting OpenUP.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Start with the core principles and understand the intentions behind OpenUP.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Then assess your existing process, and select one or two key areas that you would like to improve.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Begin using OpenUP to improve these areas first.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        In later iterations or development cycles, make incremental improvements in other areas.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        If you have little or no experience with unified processes or other iterative processes, use OpenUP in a small\n        pilot project, perhaps with only three to four people working for only two to three months.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    While OpenUP is a ready to use as-is, you may choose to extend the process or modify the work product templates to suit\n    your specific needs. For example:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        You may require more or less precision in your work products.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Your organization may have specific configuration management practices or safety protocols to include in your\n        process.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        You may simply want to put your own corporate logo on the banner.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        You may want to incorporate lessons learned from a retrospective review into OpenUP.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Use EPF Composer to extend and tailor OpenUP.

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Systems are rarely all things to all people. Often, attempts to make them so are wasteful, and result in bloated\n    systems.\n</p>\n<p>\n    To be successful, stakeholders and the project participants must converge on a clear understanding and agreement of\n    these three factors:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Problem to be solved\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Constraints placed on the development team (cost, schedule, resources, regulations, and so on)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Constraints placed on the solution\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The challenge for all project participants is creating a solution that maximizes the value delivered to the\n    stakeholders, subject to the constraints. Balance is about making the critical, cost-benefit trade-offs between desired\n    features and the subsequent design decisions that define the architecture of the system.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Discovering the balance point is challenging, elusive, and ongoing, because the balance point is dynamic. As the system\n    evolves, stakeholder needs change, new opportunities appear, risks are resolved, new risks appear, and the development\n    team discovers new realities about the system. Change happens throughout the development cycle. stakeholders and team\n    members must be prepared to re-evaluate commitments, reset expectations, and adjust plans accordingly as the system\n    evolves.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Practices\n</h3>\n<h4>\n    Know your audience\n</h4>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        You cannot know how to make effective trade-offs if you do not know who the stakeholders are and what they really\n        want.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Get to know your stakeholders. Better yet, work closely with them to ensure that you know their needs. Start by\n        identifying all stakeholders, and then maintain open and frequent communication and collaboration between them and\n        the development team.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>\n    Separate the problem from the solution\n</h4>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        Too often, we run headlong into a solution without understanding the problem. After all, we are taught how to solve\n        problems, not how to define problems, so that's easier. However, this limits your understanding of the problem,\n        imposes artificial constraints, and makes it difficult to balance trade-offs, or to even know what the trade-offs\n        are.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Make sure that you understand the problem before you define the solution. By clearly separating the problem (what\n        the customer needs) from the solution (what the system must do), it is easier to maintain the proper focus, and\n        easier to accommodate alternate ways of solving the problem.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>\n    Create a shared understanding of the domain\n</h4>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        Domain experts often have limited technical expertise; developers, architects, and testers often have limited\n        domain expertise; and reviewers and other stakeholders often have limited time to commit to the project and learn\n        the problem domain. As a result, people often have an inconsistent or poor understanding of the problem domain,\n        which causes communication problems and increases the likelihood of delivering poor value to the stakeholders.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Enhance and share all parties' understandings of the domain. A concise and shared understanding of the problem\n        domain enhances communication and project effectiveness. Start by defining the problem in the Vision document. As\n        your understanding increases, capture key domain concepts and terminology in the Glossary to ensure a consistent,\n        shared use of the language of the domain.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>\n    Use scenarios and use cases to capture requirements\n</h4>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        Many companies still document requirements as a list of declarative statements, which are sometimes called the\n        \"shall statements.\" These lists are often difficult for stakeholders to understand, because they require the end\n        user to read through and mentally translate the list into a visualization of how the requirements will interact\n        with the system.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Make use of scenarios and use cases to capture functional requirements in a form that is easy for stakeholders to\n        understand. Nonfunctional requirements, such as performance, stability, or usability requirements, are important\n        and can be documented as system-wide requirements, using traditional techniques.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>\n    Establish and maintain agreement on priorities\n</h4>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        Making poor decisions in deciding what to develop next can result in wasted effort, delivering capabilities that\n        are never used, or identifying problems late in the project (resulting in delays and even project failure).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Prioritize requirements for implementation by regularly working with the stakeholders during product evolution.\n        Make choices that deliver value and reduce risks, while building a system that can evolve.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>\n    Make trade-offs to maximize value\n</h4>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        Cost-benefit trade-offs cannot be made independent of the architecture. Requirements establish the benefits of the\n        system to the stakeholder, while architecture establishes the cost. The cost of a benefit may influence the\n        stakeholder's perceived value of the benefit.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Work with the stakeholders and team members to prioritize requirements and develop candidate architectures to\n        implement those solutions. Use the candidate architectures to evaluate the cost of the benefits. Candidate\n        solutions are considered at a high level when determining architectural feasibility. Different architectural\n        perspectives can result in different assessments of cost versus benefit. The candidate architecture that provides\n        the most coverage at the lowest cost is selected for further development.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>\n    Manage scope\n</h4>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        Change is inevitable. Although change presents opportunities to enhance stakeholder value, unconstrained change\n        will result in a bloated, deficient system and unmet stakeholder needs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Manage change while maintaining agreements with the stakeholders. Modern processes always manage change,\n        continually adapting to changes in the environment and stakeholder needs, assessing the impact of changes, making\n        trade-offs, and re-prioritizing work. stakeholder and developer expectations must be realistic and aligned\n        throughout the development lifecycle.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>\n    Know when to stop\n</h4>\n<blockquote>\n    <p>\n        Over-engineering a system not only wastes resources, but also leads to an overly complex system.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Stop developing the system when the desired quality is achieved. Remember that \"Quality is conformance to the\n        requirements\" <a href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#CRO79\" guid=\"_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig\">[CRO79]</a>. This is what gives a sense of closure to the practice. Separate the\n        problem from the solution, ensuring that the solution does, indeed, solve the problem. After the critical\n        requirements are implemented and validated, the system is ready for stakeholder acceptance.\n    </p>\n</blockquote>"

A team working in a low-trust environment may not be able to keep up with rapid change.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Take actions that foster a high-trust environment:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <b>Manage by intent.</b> Create an environment where teams manage themselves, and managers serve as mentors to\n            teams to help them complete their objectives.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <b>Tear down the walls.</b> Work to remove both the physical and mental barriers that inhibit development of a\n            common understanding among project participants.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <b>Walk a mile (or 1.6 kilometers) in someone else's shoes.</b> Respect and try to understand the perspectives\n            of others before criticizing their ideas or responding to their criticism.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <b>Respond to conversations with relevance.</b> People, especially technical workers, often respond with\n            argument or disagreement, which leads to rivalry and establishes a pecking order in which only a few people\n            contribute to the discussion. Develop and encourage behavior that values curiosity and relevance over argument\n            and disagreement.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <b>Always look to yourself first for the source of communication problems.</b> Understand that everyone has a\n            perspective that is largely invisible to the individual (although it is often obvious to everyone else).\n            Develop the habit of identifying the assumptions and prejudices within you that lead to argument or lack of\n            communication. Learn to overcome these in the moment of the conversation. This takes practice. There are times\n            when others may be intractable, but often the problem can be addressed by wrestling with your own perspective.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            <b>Understand the constraints of the workplace culture.</b> Some organizations operate in a way that allows\n            people to admit mistakes, ask questions, and experiment. Some organizations limit these expressions, but they\n            may change, with time and effort. Some organizations have no tolerance for error, and their workers put\n            themselves in danger if they admit mistakes or experiment. Understand your environment and protect yourself\n            accordingly. Understand that low-trust organizations have more problems in achieving their goals, and provide a\n            less satisfying environment.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n    Share responsibility\n</h4>\n<p>\n    There may be disadvantages for individuals when they work alone. Communication with the team can become sporadic, and\n    then stop. People may get into trouble and not ask for help, or not realize that the team is in trouble and needs their\n    help. Their understanding of the project may become misaligned with the rest of the team. In the worse situations,\n    trust breaks down as individuals see the team working at different purposes to their interests.\n</p>\n<p>\n    While individuals have primary responsibility for their work products, responsibility for work products is shared.\n    Nothing is someone else's responsibility. This may mean either taking up slack and working with someone who is lagging\n    for some reason, or asking for help. Experienced staff should be extra-vigilant and watch over less-experienced staff,\n    encouraging them to ask for help if necessary.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Learn continuously\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Not only is software development a fast-developing field where technical skills rapidly become obsolete, it is also an\n    empirical process, where software is developed in a manner that sometimes resembles trial and error. Furthermore,\n    software is developed by teams of people who must work together to achieve results.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Continuously develop both your technical and interpersonal skills. Learn from the examples of your colleagues. Take the\n    opportunity to be both a student of your colleagues, as well as a teacher to them. Always increase your personal\n    ability to overcome your own antagonism toward other team members.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Organize around the architecture\n</h4>\n<p>\n    As projects grow in size, communication between team members becomes increasingly complex. While all team members\n    understand the overall system, they can focus primarily on the one or more subsystems that they are responsible for.\n    Organizing around the architecture also helps with communication by providing the team with a common vocabulary and\n    shared mental model of the system. Communication between team members becomes increasingly complex.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Organize the team around the architecture, and the vocabulary and a shared mental model of the system. However, be\n    careful that individuals and teams organized this way do not form a so-called <i>silo mentality</i>, where they focus\n    strictly on their subsystems and become ignorant of the other subsystems.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An architecture that reflects the organization's structure is not in itself evidence that the team has successfully\n    organized around the architecture. If organizations and teams are not organized around the architecture, then the\n    architecture will naturally conform to the organization, as a result of political and cultural influences. In the end,\n    the architecture and the organization will almost always be a reflection of each other. The goal is to guide team\n    organization from the needs of the architecture as much as possible.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    It is usually not possible to know all stakeholders' needs, be aware of all project risks, comprehend all project\n    technologies, or know how to work with your colleagues. Even if it were possible to know all of these things, they are\n    likely to change over the life of the project. Promote practices that allow the team to demonstrate incremental value,\n    and to get early and continuous feedback from stakeholders.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The intention behind this principle is to continuously get feedback, and to improve both the product and the process of\n    the project team. When you provide structure and create a mindset for continuous feedback and improvement, changes are\n    accommodated more easily. In addition, feedback is captured early and often, and high-priority risks are confronted\n    early in the project. By constantly identifying and attacking risks, there is more confidence in project progress and\n    quality.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Not only does the product evolve, but the team also finds better ways to work together and get involved with\n    stakeholders. The process followed by the team can be adjusted accordingly to leverage lessons learned and adjust\n    project pace and needs.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Practices\n</h3>\n<h4>\n    Develop your project in iterations\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Developing a system in a single, linear pass is difficult, because it makes it expensive to incorporate changes and new\n    knowledge. Worse, it can delay the discovery and mitigation of risks, because development efforts are scheduled later\n    in the lifecycle.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Divide your project into a series of time-boxed <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\" href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/iteration_C20B1904.html\" guid=\"_lam4ADkBEduxovfWMDsntw\">iterations</a>, and plan your project iteratively. This iterative strategy enables you\n    to incrementally deliver capabilities (such as an executable, usable subset of implemented and tested requirements)\n    that can be assessed by stakeholders at the end of each iteration. This provides rapid and timely feedback loops, so\n    that issues can be addressed and improvements made at a lower cost. Also, this is accomplished while you still have\n    sufficient budget and time left to do so, and you have not gone so far ahead that major rework is required.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Iterative development enables teams to continuously improve software throughout the development <a class=\"elementLinkwithusertext\" href=\"./../../../process.openup.base/deliveryprocesses/openup_lifecycle_EE511F3A.html\" guid=\"_SuWj4dOPEdyqlogshP8l4g\">lifecycle</a>.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Focus iterations on meeting the next management milestone\n</h4>\n<p>\n    A project can appear to make progress while risks and unresolved issues pile up. Focus on bringing closure to important\n    project issues (such as stakeholder concurrence regarding scope, and proving the proposed architecture).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Divide the project into phases (such as <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\" href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/inception_phase_C4456871.html\" guid=\"_0hmKgBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA\">Inception</a>, <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\" href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/elaboration_phase_BE880435.html\" guid=\"_2plxwBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA\">Elaboration</a>, <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\" href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/construction_phase_873B6559.html\" guid=\"_48EKsBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA\">Construction</a> and <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\" href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/transition_phase_DD5986E5.html\" guid=\"__ca5UBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA\">Transition</a>), with each phase having a clearly visible management <a class=\"elementLinkWithUserText\" href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones_5678231E.html\" guid=\"_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg\">milestone</a>. The focus of each iteration within a phase is on achieving that\n    milestone.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Manage risks\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Deferring difficult and risky issues until later in a project significantly increases the risk of project failure. Such\n    procrastination may lead to investing in the wrong technologies, a bad design, or a set of requirements that may not\n    address stakeholder needs.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Attack <a href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/risk_AF5840DA.html\" guid=\"_0bsLgMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">risks</a> early, or they will attack you. Continuously identify and prioritize risks,\n    and then devise strategies to mitigate them. Determine the focus of iterations based on risks. For example,\n    architecturally significant risks should be addressed early in the project, no later than the end of the Elaboration\n    phase, when the architecture has been proven and baselined.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Fore more information, see <a class=\"elementLinkWithType\" href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/managing_risks_B1256EB4.html\" guid=\"_VNxL4ACsEdu8m4dIntu6jA\">Guideline: Managing Risks</a>.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Embrace and manage change\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Change is inevitable, and while change presents opportunities to enhance stakeholder value, unconstrained change will\n    result in a bloated, deficient system and unmet stakeholder needs. Furthermore, the later in the development cycle a\n    change is made, the more the change is likely to cost.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Embrace and manage change. Embracing change helps you to build a system that addresses stakeholder needs, and managing\n    change allows you to reduce costs and improve predictability of those changes. Changes made early in the project can\n    usually be made with limited cost. As you progress in your project, changes can become increasingly costly.\n</p>\n<p>\n    To satisfy customer needs, you typically need to introduce changes to the project, but the customer must be made aware\n    of the impact that those changes have on the project cost and schedule. Understand the impact of a change in the\n    current phase, and isolate team members from disruptive changes during the current iteration. Change requests are\n    reviewed and prioritized during the current iteration, but are not acted upon until assigned to a future iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If necessary, document the changes. For informal projects, a discussion with stakeholders may be enough.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Measure progress objectively\n</h4>\n<p>\n    If you do not objectively know how your project is progressing, you do not really know if it is failing or succeeding.\n    Uncertainty and change make a software project's progress difficult to measure objectively, and people are prone to\n    making objective assessments from subjective information.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Get a clear picture of project status by objectively measuring progress. The best measure of progress is the delivery\n    of working software, which is something that you do by taking an evolutionary approach. You can also define a set of\n    objective <a href=\"./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/metrics_37698708.html\" guid=\"_0mYYkMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">metrics</a> to collect during an iteration (for example, requirements that were\n    implemented and validated, number of defects issued compared with number fixed) and review them as part of the <a href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/tasks/assess_results_EC34D88D.html\" guid=\"_0l53cMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">iteration assessment</a>.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Continuously re-evaluate what you do\n</h4>\n<p>\n    On a regular basis, ask questions and verify assumptions about the project. Regularly meet with the team to track\n    status and identify risks and issues. This can be done daily when the team gathers to share the status of individual\n    responsibilities and identify and address issues. At the end of iterations, <a href=\"./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/tasks/assess_results_EC34D88D.html\" guid=\"_0l53cMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw\">assess the status</a> of what has been done and look for areas of improvement that can\n    be addressed in the next iteration. Have a retrospective review at the end of the project and capture lessons learned\n    to run future projects in a more efficient way.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If we always challenge what we do and seek new, innovative ways to develop software, we improve how we work. This leads\n    to improved project results.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Introduction\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The architecture of a software system is the organization or structure of the system's significant components\n    interacting through interfaces, with components composed of successively smaller components and interfaces.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Without an architectural foundation, a system will evolve in an inefficient and haphazard way. Such a system often\n    proves difficult to extend, reuse, or integrate without substantial rework. It is also difficult to organize the team,\n    or to communicate ideas without the <b>common technical focus</b> that the architecture provides.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Focus on the architecture early to minimize risks and organize development.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Practices\n</h3>\n<h4>\n    Create the architecture for what you know today\n</h4>\n<p>\n    As Albert Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler. Software projects are\n    resource-constrained, and the desire of developers to create elegant solutions may lead to a system of greater\n    complexity than the stakeholder requires. Efforts to future-proof a system in a turbulent or uncertain environment will\n    likely lead to code bloat, which increases overall costs and complexity with few real benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Create architectures that address the stakeholder's real needs, and provide appropriate flexibility and speed for the\n    requirements as they are known today. Avoid the desire, no matter how well-intentioned, to speculate on future\n    requirements and thereby over-engineer the architecture. There is a distinction between over-architecting and building\n    an architecture that is flexible and extensible. For example, there may not be an apparent reason for creating three\n    architectural layers in a system, but it is probable that the system will grow in ways one can't predict, so we should\n    architect for that.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Leverage the architecture as a collaborative tool\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Lack of a common understanding by developers about a system leads to indecision and contrary opinions among developers,\n    and can quickly paralyze the project. Developers may have different mental models of the system and work at cross\n    purposes to each other.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Create and evolve the system architecture with the intention of using it to align the developers' competing mental\n    models of the system. A good architecture facilitates collaboration by providing a common vocabulary for all\n    discussions regarding the system under development.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Cope with complexity by raising the level of abstraction\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Software is complex, and people have a limited capacity for coping with complexity. As a system gets larger, it is\n    difficult for the team to develop a common understanding of the system, because it's hard to see the bigger picture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Use models to raise the level of abstraction to focus on important high-level decisions, such as relationships and\n    patterns, rather than getting bogged down in details. Modeling raises the level of abstraction, and allows the system\n    to be more easily understood from different perspectives.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Organize the architecture into loosely coupled, highly cohesive components\n</h4>\n<p>\n    Tight coupling between components makes a system fragile and difficult to understand. Software is expensive to create,\n    so if existing components can be reused, that may reduce effort required to create a system.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Organize the architecture of the system into components to maximize cohesion and minimize coupling. This improves\n    comprehension, and increases flexibility and opportunities for re-use.\n</p>\n<h4>\n    Reuse existing assets\n</h4>\n<p>\n    It is wasteful to build what you can simply reuse, download, or even buy.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Make every effort to reuse existing assets. Developers are often reluctant to reuse assets, because those assets do not\n    exactly meet their needs, or those assets are of poor quality. Be prepared to balance the savings you can realize using\n    an existing asset, even if the asset requires you to make some accommodation in the architecture or relax a constraint.\n</p>"

lifecycle</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Personal effort on an OpenUP project is organized in <strong>micro-increments</strong>. These represent short units of\n    work that produce a steady, measurable pace of project progress (typically measured in hours or a few days). The\n    process applies intensive collaboration as the system is incrementally developed by a committed, self-organized team.\n    These micro-increments provide an extremely short feedback loop that drives adaptive decisions within each iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    OpenUP divides the project into iterations: planned, time-boxed intervals typically measured in weeks. Iterations focus\n    the team on delivering incremental value to stakeholders in a predictable manner. The iteration plan defines what\n    should be delivered within the iteration, and the result is a demo-able or shippable build. OpenUP teams self-organize\n    around how to accomplish iteration objectives and commit to delivering the results. They do that by defining and\n    \"pulling\" fine-grained tasks from a work items list. OpenUP applies an <strong>iteration lifecycle</strong> that\n    structures how micro-increments are applied to deliver stable, cohesive builds of the system that incrementally\n    progresses towards the iteration objectives.\n</p>\n<p>\n    OpenUP structures the <strong>project lifecycle</strong> into four phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and\n    Transition. The project lifecycle provides stakeholders and team members with visibility and decision points throughout\n    the project. This enables effective oversight, and allows you to make \"go or no-go\" decisions at appropriate times. A\n    project plan defines the lifecycle, and the end result is a released application.\n</p>"

Because neither of these areas\n    are strengths of the software development community, two new roles have been introduced that take advantage of the\n    experience and expertise of niche support staff often found in or around an IT organization.\n</p>\n<p>\n    By playing to the strengths and availability of Technical Writers, Course Developers,&nbsp;and Trainers, a Development\n    Team does not need to worry about who will write the user documents and train end users - in this case, they can have\n    the specialists accept those responsibilities. Also, working with these two specialists ultimately will improve the\n    development team's ability to articulate details of the system that they are building and provide insight into subtle\n    ways to better comment and document their code.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Virtually all applications that are developed will be used or supported by people. Very often, however, both the\n    documentation and training aspects of systems implementation are overlooked or not given enough emphasis. Inattention\n    to these areas can result in a product that does not achieve its full business value because the people who should\n    benefit from the application are not fully informed or trained.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Although this practice is documented and adopted at the development team level, in some organizations it may be\n    advantageous to consolidate and integrate all types of documentation and training materials at the program level and\n    deliver one comprehensive package to stakeholders, end users, and IT operations support personnel for the entire\n    release across the program.\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Getting started with this practice\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The goal of the Documentation and Training practice is to ensure that end users of a product receive quality\n    information about the product (in comprehensive documentation) and have been adequately trained regarding how to use\n    the product.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Common pitfalls\n</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Inadequate documentation:</strong> No one likes to rigorously document a product, least of all the team\n        members who developed it. Historically, product documentation often has been an afterthought, if given thought at\n        all. In the Agile world, because the goal is to deliver high quality, working software to end users more quickly,\n        realize that part of the quality component is adequate documentation that enables end users to use the product more\n        effectively.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Non-existent or inadequate training:</strong> Like documentation, training often is an afterthought. When\n        product budgets are reduced, training often is the first line item to be eliminated. However, in fairness to the\n        end user community, proper training about how to use the product is critical to the overall success of product\n        deployment in terms of enabling end users do their jobs effectively.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n    Considerations\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The following is a list of points to consider when adopting this practice:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Training depends on documentation:</strong> The better the documentation, the easier it is to develop\n        training materials. If your team skimps on the quality and quantity of product documentation, the cost of training\n        materials development will significantly increase.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Documentation can be developed in many ways:</strong> The more varied the documentation media (e.g., Help\n        files, Wizards, PowerPoint presentations, video vignettes, etc.), the easier it will be to use those forms of\n        documentation and convert them into robust training modules. Also, multiple forms of documentation will appeal to a\n        broader audience because people internalize information differently: what works for one person might not resonate\n        with another.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Training can be delivered in many ways:</strong> Like documentation, training delivery media should be\n        varied to appeal to different audiences. Not only can training be delivered by a live instructor in a classroom,\n        other options include:\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none\">\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                Computer-based training where users complete modules on their own time\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                On-line instructor-led modules delivered over the Internet at scheduled times\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Just-in-time training modules (either live or on-line instructor-led) for incremental learning\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>"

                          "<p>\n    A release consists of integrated, compiled code that runs cleanly, independently, and in its entirety. This is an\n    important rule because in order to be released or even \"potentially shippable,\" a release increment must be able to\n    stand on its own, otherwise it is not shippable. Releases&nbsp;can be created at either the program or team level.\n</p>\n<p>\n    There are three potential uses for a release:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>It is not used outside of the program:</strong> It has been produced to minimize risks linked to technology\n        and a program's capability to integrate components and to produce a Build. This situation usually happens at the\n        beginning of a new product lifecycle.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>It is used by beta customers and the program manager:</strong> It allows end users to test it in a Beta\n        test environment, which provides immediate feedback and reduces risks associated with user interface ergonomics.\n        customer feedback will influence the program backlog for later consideration.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>It is deployed or shipped and used by end users:</strong> This result provides immediate value to the end\n        users.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    In many organizations, a program release typically is timeboxed to 2 to 3 months of development effort and 2 to 4 weeks\n    of hardening which results in a scheduled release approximately every 90 days. Releases for individual development\n    teams usually occur more often than those for programs, but there are no hard and fast rules regarding how often\n    releases should be scheduled. The only requirement is that working software should be delivered \"frequently\" by both\n    development teams and programs. Although the example timeframe described above is arbitrary, empirical evidence\n    suggests it is about right for most companies and fits nicely into quarterly planning cycles.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Each release has a set of release objectives and a projected delivery date; it also has a planned number of\n    sprint/iterations. For example, a brief description of a release might be: \"The goal of Release 2 is to provide B2B\n    scheduling capability for the Ordering and Logistics Department. The release is targeted for June 31 and will consist\n    of five 2-week feature development sprint/iterations and&nbsp;one 2-week release sprint/iteration.\"\n</p>"

                      "<h3>\n    Getting started with this practice\n</h3>\n<p>\n    The goal of the Production Release practice is to transform the business value developed in Feature Development\n    Sprint/Iterations into a finished product that can be released into production along with other products as part of a\n    coordinated Release.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If a development team has never practiced Production Release before, the best way to think of this special type of\n    Sprint/Iteration is to consider a past project in which your team spent a week of 16-hour days doing all the things\n    necessary to prepare for a deployment based on an arbitrary release date. Then realize that you do not have to operate\n    like that any more, and that a Production Release Sprint/Iteration is your opportunity to calmly deal with all the\n    preparatory activities that accompany a well-managed, coordinated release while other development team members are\n    doing the same. In short, the Production Release practice represents the way you always wished you could prepare for a\n    release but did not have the opportunity.\n</p>\n<h3>\n    Common pitfalls\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Because production release provides a development team the opportunity to \"fine tune\" a product and tighten up\n    problematic areas of the code, it is good practice not to squander that Sprint/Iteration.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>A Release Sprint/Iteration is not a time to rest:</strong> Some development team members think that when\n        they get to Production Release they can relax and not work too hard. However, when practicing the Agile value of\n        Sustainable Pace, teams should <em>not need to</em> rest, and team members should maintain the tempo that they\n        established during previous Feature Development Sprint/Iterations.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Testing is not more important than documentation and training:</strong> While the various types of testing\n        that are conducted in a Release Sprint/Iteration (integration, system, UAT) are important, documentation and\n        training are just as important because how well end users can actually use the product to do their work is critical\n        to a successful delivery.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Successful hardening is more important than squeezing in marginally tested features:</strong> Do not think\n        that more features delivered is necessarily better. While there is always a temptation to deliver more\n        functionality in a Release, resist that desire and deliver only features that are mature and have been well tested\n        and integrated.\n    </li>\n</ul>"
